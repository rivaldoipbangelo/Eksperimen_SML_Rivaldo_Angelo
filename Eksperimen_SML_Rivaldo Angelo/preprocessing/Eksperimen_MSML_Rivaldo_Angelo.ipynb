Mostly this entailed Star Wars prequel news, and rumors surrounding a 5th Batman installment(in continuation Schumacher\\'s films). One of the things I saw, though, was a picture of the Green Goblin, and when my older brother called me a loser when he also saw the picture. Considering that the costume looked like some cheap Power Rangers outfit, I can\\'t say I blame him, but part of me was more or less just unconvinced whether it was a real movie or not. Back in those days, being a kid and all, I couldn\\'t tell the difference between fake internet rumors concerning sequels and actual movie news. Later that same year, when I saw The Fellowship of the Ring,  the first Lord of the Rings film, there was a trailer before the film for Spiderman. It blew my mind, but not so much because I was a huge Spiderman fan. The truth is I liked the 90\\'s cartoon and enjoyed reruns of the older Spiderman and His Amazing Friends show,  but what amazed me was that I could tell that it was going to be visually spectacular. It blended what I thought only worked in animation with live-action angles that I had only seen in The Matrix. I did everything to make sure I was able to see it the day it came out, May 3rd, 2002. I\\'m not lying when I tell you that I didn\\'t have to look up that date. However, when the movie did finally come out I was disappointed. I was 12 years old, and I felt like it was a little kids movie in the way it embraced the cheesiness. Ultimately, I kind of just decided it was good. It didn\\'t take long for me to look past the faults and enjoy the film anyway. I ended up buying it on DVD and enjoying it for years to come, but the general life lesson was to not get my hopes up over a movie. In the end, it wasn\\'t so much the movie\\'s fault, but my own for expecting it to be something more than it could be.

My mom took on Friday night in town but there was a cop there saying there\\'s only 10 tickets left for Spider-Man. A few seconds pass its all sold out. I was so mad. So the next day my mom took me to AMC theater which its my first time even going there. When The Hulk trailer was on Spider-Man I\\'m like oh wow another Marvel movie. As we watched Spider-Man the funny part was when Spider-Man was on the ceiling and his blood drop off of him and hit the floor as Norman heard it hit the floor. My mom said which she literally realized she said it so loud. She said \"\"oh he heard that\"\" the whole theater laughed so loud too cuz of what she said. Then later that day I saw it again with my older sister and her friend. When it came out on DVD and VHS my mom rented it for me and walked it all weekend long.

He grew up with the classic 60s and 70s comics and kinda stopped afterwards. He researched more modern stuff like Ultimate for these films and I think he deserves credit for that. Spider-Man 3 was not his movie. It was the movie Sony forced him to make because people like me were begging for Venom to come in and that conflicted with his ideal Spider-Man 3. \\n\\nHe even toyed with the idea of using characters like Black Cat, Lizard, Vulture, and Electro and you can see it in concept art. Also he wanted to do this cool montage at the start of Spider-Man 4 where Spidey beats up guys like Rhino, Shocker, Prowler, and even Mysterio (Bruce Campbell we were so close to the perfect cameo) Obviously Spider-Man 3 isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t perfect, but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s still entertaining to this day and I have more fun watching it now with these facts in mind.\",0,2020-08-20T02:26:04Z,\\nRu8ZahJ9BUE,@ahappyklingon3631,JK Simmons is and will always be my all-time favorite casting choice .

But then I\\'ve always been a sucker for origin stories.  I think what really does it the most for me though in this particular film is how we get to discover and be amazed right alongside Peter as he\\'s first realizing his potential.  Also, Willem Dafoe.  Da foe.  The Foe.  While I actually liked Maguire a lot in those films, after Tom Holland came along, Tom replaced Toby as the best \"\"Peter Parker\"\", even if I still believe the first two Spider-Man films as a whole are more enjoyable.\\n\\nAlso, I grew up as a comic book nerd, and Spider-Man and Batman were my favorite solo characters (although more Spider-Man by a huge margin) and X-Men for team characters.  All growing up I always wondered how long it would take before we got those translated to film in a good way, if ever.  The Burton movies were great for what he was able to do, but they still seemed both simultaneously low-key and over the top and not quite what I was wanting.  When the first two Rami films hit, they just floored me, and I thought \"\"We have finally arrived\"\" in terms of translating a comic book character, with the feel of a comic book character, and without being ridiculous to film.  Then Nolan came along and made things \"\"more grounded\"\", and I thoroughly loved the first two of his Batman films.  Forward to Avengers and what Marvel has been able to do with the MCU, and for the most part it\\'s everything a kid like me would have wanted back then (shitty Hulk CGI aside).

Or Harry fails to take control of Venom but we can see Harry ahs changed and forgives Peter but Venom is in control and they have to destory Venom and Harry dies in the process.

A teenager in high school with high school problems and I LOVED that. I always say that Tobey\\'s Spider-man was my first love of comic books. Like I have a special place in my heart for his Spider-man and his movies.

Like to this day I still get chills and sit at the edge of my seat when I see the train scene.

My family didnt have much growing up, so birthdays where a small toy and a meal, we didnt have the money to do more. I was 5 and saw the ad on tv for this movie called spiderman coming out near my birthday and I just thought I really want to see that. I went around the neighborhood collecting cans and doing chores to find money for the movie. On the day of my birthday I said I\\'d go to a friends house and went to the theater with a pocketful of change.\\n I didn\\'t know how money worked, so I just dropped it all on the counter and said I want to see spiderman. The guy at the booth helped me out by counting my coins, helped me with the menu and brought me to the auditorium. And there I was, with my small popcorn and my medium coke, enjoying the birthday gift I had worked so hard for. I didn\\'t really understand the plot, I was scared shitless during Norman\\'s transformation to the point that I had nightmares and thats how my parents found out. But I was so happy. I fell in love with cinema at that moment.\\n I can\\'t hear the opening theme without tearing up a bit, it brings back the feeling that I could do everything and that I would work my way to my goals.  It\\'s my most cherished cinema going experience.\\n And to this day that is still how I celebrate my birthday. I have no party for myself, no gifts (my gf and mother always plan something now and get me a little something) but I still go to the cinema and with the spare change I got through the year I buy myself a ticket, a popcorn and a coke and feel invincible.\\nThank you Jeremy for reviewing this, your videos mean so much to me, they helped me think about the world in a different way in a time I needed it, they even lead into meeting my said girlfriend, but thats a story for another time.

It wasn\\'t really a problem back then, but now that we have complex villains with complex motivations, it\\'s something I noticed. Norman\\'s motivation was to wipe out everyone who stood in the way of him and his company because they wanted to kick him out of his own company... at first. But after his first fight with Spider-Man, there really is no reason for Norman to be the Goblin again. He had already succeeded in his goal before Spidey showed up. He killed all the board members, and Norman Osborn is now the only person in charge of Oscorp, he now has all the power he wanted. He could\\'ve been on his merry way and Peter would have no clue what his intentions were. Peter doesn\\'t actively investigate for the Goblin, and doesn\\'t even suspect Norman is behind all of this, so everything Goblin does from that point forward was just because they needed Spider-Man to fight a big villain.\",0,2020-08-18T20:51:27Z,\\nRu8ZahJ9BUE,@mav_3rix354,review red dead 2,1,2020-08-18T20:50:59Z,\\nRu8ZahJ9BUE,@GamerLegend.97,Oh Jeremy is going to need more tequila after seeing Spider-Man 3 if you thought Powers was horrible wait until you see Spider-Man 3 you\\'ll be drunk all night and crying in the corner\\xf0\\x9f\\x98\\x82\\xf0\\x9f\\x98\\x82\\xf0\\x9f\\x98\\x82\\xf0\\x9f\\x98\\x82\\xf0\\x9f\\x98\\x82\\xf0\\x9f\\x98\\x82\\xf0\\x9f\\x98\\x82\\xf0\\x9f\\x98\\x82\\xf0\\x9f\\x98\\x82\\xf0\\x9f\\x98\\x82\\xf0\\x9f\\x98\\x82\\xf0\\x9f\\x98\\x82\\xf0\\x9f\\x98\\x82\\xf0\\x9f\\x98\\x82\\xf0\\x9f\\x98\\x82\\xf0\\x9f\\x98\\x82\\xf0\\x9f\\x98\\x82\\xf0\\x9f\\x98\\x82\\xf0\\x9f\\x98\\x82,0,2020-08-18T20:50:49Z,\\nRu8ZahJ9BUE,@enegmatixerebro,Although Spider-Man never grows spiderwebs out his wrists...

The Raimi films had a lot of heart and I think is what elevated them considerably among the rest. MCU Spidey gets a lot of credit for being the Spider-Man that finally joins the Avengers which you know \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhoa! Spider-Man in the Avengers! Cool!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Not a snarky comment btw) but I think the novelty of it wears off. Sam Raimi didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have any of that or in fact, didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really need any of it to sell Spider-Man. Instead, he added a lot of impact and weight to his stories. Say what you will about Spider-Man 3, but it gave us life lessons on forgiveness and revenge and put a lot of impact into Harry\\xe2\\x80\\x99s death which is honestly more than I can say for the end of Endgame. And to me, that says a lot about the storytelling of both franchises. One succeeds by having multiple superheroes on screen, while the other succeeded by telling a compelling story which really showed the burdens that came with being a superhero. And that to me, is what audiences will look back more on. Not from being on screen with other large established characters. Not from having mindblowing set pieces. But from having a lot of heart, which is something I think comic book movies could really take a page from. And the Sam Raimi trilogy really had a lot of it.\",0,2020-08-18T20:47:53Z,\\nRu8ZahJ9BUE,@miller413,Don\\'t ever shit on spiderman 3 ..... its a great film,0,2020-08-18T20:47:33Z,\\nRu8ZahJ9BUE,@NightsDwarf,\"u should review \"\"A Scanner Darkly\"\" a weird keanu reeves movie featuring woody harldson and iron man i mean robert downey jr. its animated too!\",0,2020-08-18T20:47:06Z,\\nRu8ZahJ9BUE,@gor9027,Oh I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t wait for Jeremy to get to Spider-Man 3.,0,2020-08-18T20:46:49Z,\\nRu8ZahJ9BUE,@random1725,BoneSaw is readyyyy,0,2020-08-18T20:46:15Z,\\nRu8ZahJ9BUE,@UnclePhilly421,William Defoe still is the best Spider Man villain no contest,0,2020-08-18T20:46:06Z,\\nRu8ZahJ9BUE,@shanedarby6501,I remember going to see this discreetly on my own back in 2002 as a 15 year old teenager (different times before he was as cool as he is now)  always loved the Spiderman cartoon as a kid and came out of the cinema completely blown away!

It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s *flawed*, no question. But it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s still a good film. Eddie Brock as a scumbag version of Peter Parker who literally shirks off responsibility at every turn is a good example of Sam Raimi doing what he does best with these films and emphasize the villains as dark reflections of the the Hero. With Norman, it was blind ambition. With Otto, it was hyper-fixation. Both of these demons were manifested into actual totems in the form of Osborn\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Goblin persona and the tentacles taking over Octavius\\xe2\\x80\\x99s higher brain function (you can actually SEE the transition as the light on them changes color). \\n\\nWith Eddie, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all about his inability to actually own up to his own faults. He never actively dates Gwen outside of a single coffee meet-up but can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t take a hint. He rightfully gets fired for faking pictures for the Bugle, but literally prays for God to striker Peter Parker dead. I think the flaws come from Venom having to be wrapped up entirely in a single film, rather than being set up in 3 and then becoming a looming antagonist in 4, but Raimi did as best he could with the studio interfering as much as they did. \\xf0\\x9f\\xa4\\xb7\\xf0\\x9f\\x8f\\xbd\\xe2\\x80\\x8d\\xe2\\x99\\x82\\xef\\xb8\\x8f\",0,2020-08-18T20:12:58Z,\\nRu8ZahJ9BUE,@clarkkent5006,Watchmen and indiana jones triology next please,0,2020-08-18T20:12:54Z,\\nRu8ZahJ9BUE,@lukasbernasiewicz405,Jeremy looks like a caveman,0,2020-08-18T20:12:47Z,\\nRu8ZahJ9BUE,@armandoc2584,One of the most meme movies ever I still love it,0,2020-08-18T20:12:45Z,\\nRu8ZahJ9BUE,@nossvelic,Best quarantine beard award!!!!,0,2020-08-18T20:12:35Z,\\nRu8ZahJ9BUE,@n0r3mac,i panicked for a second when i didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t hear the intro music,0,2020-08-18T20:12:31Z,\\nRu8ZahJ9BUE,@CamSeanoaTolls26,Spiderman 2 tho... \\xf0\\x9f\\x99\\x8c\\xf0\\x9f\\x8f\\xbe,0,2020-08-18T20:12:23Z,\\nRu8ZahJ9BUE,@imnotayoshi8685,\"I was 10 when this movie came out, spidey was my favorite marvel hero I grew up with both x-men and Spider-Man the animated series\\'.

Also heartbreaking scenes where aunt May is blaming herself for Uncle Ben\\'s death and having to deal with overdue bills are nowhere to be found in the MCU spiderman films. That spiderman never really struggles with everything and he never deals with consequences to his choices like being a jerk to uncle ben or not attending Mary Jane\\'s plays etc. Tobey Maguire Maguire spiderman takes life lessons he is taught by other people and uses them to defuse the situation as seen with Doctor Octopus in spiderman 2.

The combat is a blast but can still be challenging even when you have hours of practice. It never pushes the easy button. \\n\\nThe Graphics are breathtaking, the city looks amazing even when moving at high speed. The cutscenes are polished, well acted and engaging. Hearing JJ rage about Spiderman while you swing around is priceless. The webswinging is what every fan of Spiderman 2 has been wanting, not only is it epic but it\\'s also strangely relaxing. \\n\\nThe collecting of Pigeons, Drone and Bomb challenges are exercises in webswinging skill. It is asking how fast and nimble you can be.  Stealth and Combat challenges are how you can judge your thug beating skills or Noir spidey style.\\n\\nThe Backpacks are little glimpses into Spiderman lore and Peter parks life all in one. The Landmarks are nods to real locations in new York (excluding MCU buildings) which also bring the sense that Spidey loves his city. The Suits are a mix of nods to MCU and some from the movies and comic books, most with a unique look and ability. Also the small but noticable addition to high five New Yorkers on the street really makes you FEEL like your Friendly Neighborhood Spiderman! 10.0!

In the older spider man games you SUPER JUMP from building to building and land so hard from free falls that there were imprint cracks in the ground. MINOR details I noticed. Other than that GREAT game for the NEW generation. Great starting point and hope there could possibly be a SPIDER MAN 2 like the old days. I haven\\'t completed the game yet or gathered all of the skills YET so I\\'m hoping I could possibly gain the power to SUPER charge JUMP. Until then my thoughts remain the same.

No but smooth and fast enough for the average game. 24 and 30fps is fine when watching a movie but when it comes to gaming, you will more than likely need those extra frames, when it comes to a hard boss or to react to something in time.

That could still happen, you know... Tom truly, truly plays a wonderful Young Spider-Man. There are two different interpretations of Spider-Man--A young, high school Peter Parker governed by Aunt May and curfews. And an older, married, money-troubled Peter Parker with age and wisdom.

If she didn\\'t love him, she shouldn\\'t have let it escalate that far before breaking his heart). I would also like to point out that the first two films are nearly identical with the villain\\'s arcs (only with Doc Ock being more likeable before his experiment goes wrong) MJ and Peter getting closer before love confessions at the expense of an innocent (Harry and Jameson\\'s son -you know, the astronaut?) as well as the kidnapping of MJ and nearly note-for-note the same power discovery scene (yes, I understand that it is supposed to be symbolic but to me has always come across as more robotic) and rejecting followed by living by Uncle Bens \"\"Great power, Great responsibility\"\" motto.\\nC) Woefully scripted (How does Peter think that learning poetry makes up for being ignorant an unfeeling towards MJ, even if he was doing it for the greater good -MJ doesn\\'t know that! the characters are also devoid of all subtlety and just state the blindingly obvious with as little inflection in their voices as possible.\\nI am well aware that this will be a very unpopular comment. Have at it, these films are only great in concept but after having watched them all I can say is that I find Peter a poor role model and (again) poorly acted so nothing is made up for, MJ a terrible role-model and a walking stereotype and the film overall simply dreary.\\nI\\'d rather watch Green Lantern.

He loved it back then so he doesnt wanna change that because it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s part of his childhood. \\nIn my opinion tom holland is the best spdierman then tobey. But 1) spiderman doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have organic web so by you saying it fits him cuz he doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have the money to make web shooters and shit is dumb cuz he had the money to make that nice ass suit and fix it time after time. And if he did had organic web how is the web going through his custome when his swinging??! 2) his protayal of spiderman after he gets bit doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really change in the comics and cartoons spiderman gets like a ego/confidence boost and in all 3 raimi movies tobey protays him the same kinda wimpy weird kid ass peter and spiderman. 4) in the balcony scene that yiu were talking about the bomb my only thing about that is how Didnt harry get killed aswell he was literally like 2 feet away from the bomb. 5)green goblin and j jonah were amazing picks for actors. 6) the power ranger suit is ten times better then herpe face lmfao 7) u didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t seem to mind how all the high schoolers look 30, the teacher was younger then them lol 8) the acting was bad!

So I get what you\\'re saying with people just piling on the \\'narrative\\' online, but c\\'mon...that shit was Power Rangers as FUCK. And that\\'s not even an awful thing, I loved the Power Rangers growing up too, but if you\\'re going to cast Willem Dafoe and then put him in a mask that hides his face completely (and has no good explanation even within the narrative), I mean...that still kinda sucks.\\n\\n\\nThat having been said, there are large swaths of this movie that are awesome, including the characters and ESPECIALLY the acting. It never gets enough credit, but not only is JK Simmons the perfect JJJ, he even has that moment when Green Goblin is trying to get Peter\\'s name out of him, and Jonah, DESPITE Peter literally standing 3 feet away, covers for him. Says he doesn\\'t know who keeps getting the Spider-Man pictures. That moment imbues the character with SO MUCH humanity, the idea that he\\'s a jerk. He\\'s greedy. He\\'s a little power-drunk, but he\\'s NOT. A. COWARD. He\\'s not going to sell out some kid to save his own skin.\\n\\n\\nAlso I find anyone who thinks earnest-but-corny teen crushes in movies to be \\'too much\\' are willfully burying their own memories of it.

On top of that, I went to Universal\\'s Islands of Adventure, which has Marvel Superhero Island. I could compare and contrast the Spider-Man ride and the movie. After growing up watching the 90s TV show on Fox Kids, this film really felt like a comic book coming to life. If I were to compare the late 70s/80s/90s/early 2000s blockbuster era to the 2010s blockbuster, the late 70s/80s/90s/early 2000s wins because it wasn\\'t oversaturated and was not trying too hard (well except the Star Wars Prequels but that\\'s another story haha). This film holds up much like how Star Wars: A New Hope, Jurassic Park, Back to the Future, Indiana Jones, Batman, Superman, E.T. etc. hold up. Spider-Man 2 and X-2, to me, closed the \"\"old style\"\" blockbuster era because the Dark Knight films, Iron Man, Casino Royale, Transformers, and Avatar would start the new blockbuster era that continued in the 2010s.

I prefer the amazing Spider-Man over this one actually. Not that the movie is bad, but a few things but me from enjoying this film. 1. The effects. I\\'m sorry but most of these effects did not age well at all. Keep in mind films like terminator Judgement 2 and Jurassic Park came out years before this so this film has no excuse. 2. A lot of the action is kinda corny. I mean the final battle and the one in the burning building are pretty good, but every other fight lacks good choreography, stakes, and intensity. 3. Its goofy moments. I\\'m ok with J.K. Simmons overacting as Jameson because the character is essentially a big loud cartoon. But the green goblin costume looks pretty silly.

Kind of surprised you didn\\'t really go into any of it. Few examples:\\n\\n- In the scene where he fights Flash near the lockers, how did everyone know to clear a path for Flash to fly past them? Also, if you pay attention to the larger kid in the background, after the fight is over you can see him with his mouth wide open, shocked by what he saw. When it cuts back to him seconds later, he\\'s clapping with a smug smile, and then he reverts back to having his mouth wide open in shock again.\\n\\n- In the scene when he uses his web to cross the street for the first time (after the \"\"Up up and away web!\"\" bit), he clearly bounces off the wall, only to have the scene cut and we see him comically slide down it. Seems like the editors should have trimmed the previous clip just a bit more.\\n\\n- Once he tracks down the Ben\\'s killer, he knocks the gun out of his hand during the fight, but seconds later the guy has the gun in his hand again.\\n\\n- The scene where he is forced to make a choice between saving MJ and the cable car makes absolutely no sense to me. The only thing keeping that cable car from plummeting into the river is the tension Goblin is keeping on the cable. Once he releases it, the line should have gone slack and the only way Spiderman could have saved it was to web the car itself, or get hold of the end of the line Goblin was holding. Instead, somehow the car slips to the end of the cable and latches on, and the other end of the cable, which should extend the length of the path, is now only about 150 ft long and Spiderman is able to grab on to that end of it. Huh?\\n\\nI really only have these gripes because I\\'ve seen the movie enough to notice them. Still one of my favorite Superhero movies though.

Well... at least in later movies. He was okay in the first I guess, but I feel he never really grows out of it like he does in the comic. I can\\'t really agree about your opinion on romance, but considering I had no romance until I was an adult and the one I had was a bad experience to me, I am probably not the right person to judge what a teenage romance should be. I do agree with you on the organic web-shooter however, for the same reasons as well as one more: it always bugged me that he never ran out of web in the middle of a jump. As for Green Goblin, I think people missed one point: unlike Power Rangers, where the bad guys are meant to be real monsters, the Goblin is MEANT to be a guy in a suit, so it actually makes sense for his suit to be like this.\",0,2016-03-20T22:51:05Z,\\n_hgLxreqpQQ,@indexsonic,\"Good review, I guess you don\\'t like MCU then? lol\",0,2016-03-20T12:55:55Z,\\n_hgLxreqpQQ,@twanduvigneau5809,I bet Spider man 2 will have an A,0,2016-03-18T18:51:20Z,\\n_hgLxreqpQQ,@RichardHorpe,the fight between spidey and green goblin was fucking brutal. all bloody and shit. nowadays superheroes can\\'t show even one drop of blood unless it\\'s from netflix. fucking pussies.,0,2016-03-18T03:58:41Z,\\n_hgLxreqpQQ,@Majesticon,\"oh my god, THANK YOU! the absurdity that peter parker doesn\\'t have natural webs is just shitty. i get why they originally wanted him to create his web technologically to show how smart he is, but it\\'s a lot more believable if his webs are organic\",0,2016-03-17T20:28:14Z,\\n_hgLxreqpQQ,@danialfairoz8712,Has anyone ever told you you look like Paul Rudd?

Whereas with Willam Dafoe\\'s Green Goblin suit, it makes absolutely no sense why a mega corporate company like Oscorp has a battle suit with such a ridiculous design, comic book movie or not, no scientific weapons company would ever create something that stupid looking, there\\'s suspending disbelief and then there\\'s just silly, but I understand and respect your thoughts.

Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone are just fantastic. A lot of people have a problem with Andrew as Peter because \"\"he\\'s too cool\"\", \"\"Spider-Man is supposed to be a nerd\"\". Well I can tell you, the nerd of the 60s does not exist. Mark Webb tried to to a modern version of the nerd, more of an outsider. I was 17 when I watched TASM and it was so fucking relatable. Every scene with Peter and Gwen are so real to me. They are also supposed to be like 17 right? Maybe I was just lucky but in my school no one acts like they do in the the original Spider-Man, bullies who beat people up? Really? Like I said, maybe it\\'s just my school but we were way more mature, Flash in SM1 acts like a 10 year old.\\n\\nThe Amazing Spider-Man is one of my favourite movies just because of the relatability and the performances. I realize that it\\'s not the best movie in the series from a critical standpoint, but it definitely has a special place for me.\\n\\nI think we all have a different point of view of what Spider-Man is supposed to be (I read Ultimate Spider-Man growing up for example, not 616) and thus we prefer different versions of the character.

Peter Parker\\'s character isn\\'t just a nerd, which seems to be a common misconception to casual fans. Once Peter becomes Spider-Man in the comics, the real him starts to surface: a cool, likable, funny, easy going person that was always pushed around due to his lack of confidence. Peter gains confidence through Spider-Man, there\\'s growth in his character (Even Flash Thompson, someone who would bully Peter befriends him after he starts to stand up for himself). Tobey\\'s portrayal had no real growth throughout the three movies, he remained the same nerdy, loser, Peter throughout the series. Tobey\\'s Spider-Man barely made any quips  like he does in the comics. As much as enjoyed Tobey\\'s portrayal when I was younger, it is far from being a perfect Peter Parker and not as accurate as Andrew Garfield\\'s take.

The reason is that Raimi managed to very nicely capture and bring the feel of the 60s comics to modern times without being hokey. He understood the characters and their relationships and brought them all to the screen beautifully. I loved all three movies, even Spider-man 3 which so many people knock. People sometimes forget that the faults of Spider-man 3 are more to do with the Studio than with Raimi... he didn\\'t originally have Venom in the movie but added the character due to studio pressure. But he made a great movie anyway as far as I\\'m concerned. My main complaint is that the studio didn\\'t stick with Raimi - sure, diminishing returns and all that, but the argument doesn\\'t work in this case. The movie only made slightly less than the 2nd one domestically, coming in at 337 mil, and almost 900 mil worldwide which makes it the top grosser of the three. And Sony dropped him? Really? Sony and it\\'s stoopid meddling do not deserve this character.

After watching this i really feel like going back and seeing the movie again. \\nOn the Spider-Man thing and the quips and what not, I honestly like Tobey Maguire as Spider-Man. He was fantastic when it came out and ultimately he killed it in the role. \\n\\nHowever, his character just lacked progression to me. My whole thing with Peter Parker personally is that he shows some of the best character progression out of any comic book character. \\n-He\\'s a soft spoken Nerd. Looked down upon by everyone, and falls in love with a girl hopelessly out of his league. He wants to be more. He\\'s insecure and weak and loves science and blah blah. \\n-He gets super powers and immediately you have given power to a guy who has always been weak. Has always been picked on and pushed around and now he instantly wants to show the world that he\\'s better. He gets cocky. He becomes basically an asshole, because that\\'s how the world treated him, so who cares? \\n-Then his Uncle dies and he learns the Great Power/Responsibility stuff. He\\'s immediately humbled and grows as a person. \\n--But even though he\\'s doing all these amazing things and fighting all these people and villains, it\\'s not like he\\'s automatically fearless. He\\'s just a nerd from queens, of course he\\'s scared! He\\'s scared out of his mind! And because he\\'s scared he hides that by making quips. He belittles his villains, he basically humiliates them! Because if you\\'re fighting sociopathic humanoid Rhinos and psychotic killer \"\"goblins\"\" and whatnot, the first instinct is to make fun of them so they don\\'t seem all that scary. That\\'s why the quips are so essential to his character. \\n\\nTobey just never got passed the Nerd stage and he never grew as a character. He was the same. \\nAndrew is closer to a perfect Spiderman to me, but ultimately he didn\\'t show that outcast side enough. He didn\\'t seem all that weak or whatever, so when he got his powers it\\'s not like he changed much, he just was himself. \\n\\nA lot of people don\\'t seem to recognize much that Nerd Peter Parker is only like 10% at best of Spider-man\\'s whole character. He\\'s like that in the beginning but that quickly fades.\",0,2016-01-16T15:31:27Z,\\n_hgLxreqpQQ,@combobreaker9618,Did you review the Christian Bale\\'s Batman Trilogy?,0,2016-01-16T15:17:06Z,\\n_hgLxreqpQQ,@Jay_Rodimus,\"Thanks for helping pass the time for civil war like you did with the force awakens, seriously, this helps me not to go crazy waiting.\",0,2016-01-16T15:16:15Z,\\n_hgLxreqpQQ,@russianbot2179,\"Green Goblin being a Power Ranger is the same as Jar Jar Binks ruining a Star Wars movie.

The downside to keeping Mary Jane as the girl Peter can\\'t have is that her character wasn\\'t explored very well, hence people grumbles about her just being eye candy.  And one of the things the third movie did right is explore her life more now that both her and Peter were a couple.  Plus you have all these other characters to and relationships to explore as well so MJ ends up getting pushed Into the background.  But I will never disagree with anyone who says she had too many damsel in distress scenes.  I have to give Kudos to Marc Webb for casting Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy.  Stone\\'s personality is so colorful, she could do a romance about being in love with a rock and you\\'d still believe it! But pushing Aunt May the way he did to the side was unforgivable!

You made a point about the quips, and how they really shouldn\\'t overshadow anything and they should just be for the laughs, but that really isn\\'t very Spider-Man like. Spider-Man uses his quips mostly because he was bullied. Since he was bullied, and now he can overpower most people, he sort of becomes a bully towards his enemies. I just didn\\'t feel that his transformation from the nerdy Peter Parker to the strong Spider-Man was all that effective, since he basically seemed to be the same person aside from his confidence personality wise. \\n\\nBut, despite that, it\\'s still my favorite Spider-Man movie. Maybe Spider-Man 2 (it\\'s really close - maybe even equal), I\\'m not sure. And, despite most people, I actually really liked Amazing Spider-Man.

You brought across every point I\\'ve had about this movie. Nostalgia aside, this has always been my favorite movie, by that being no superhero movie that I\\'ve seen since then (even Spider-Man 2) has left such an impression on me. Kudos on the cgi issue, for  the budgets movies have now a days, it\\'s sucks they cheap out and go for it rather than making awesome special-fx.  And an even bigger thank you on the whole \"\"this movie is too cheesy/campy\"\". Most Marvel movies now, all have some cheese to it. As well with the \"\"Green Goblin Power Ranger suit\"\", having grown up as a fan of both as well, yeah it resembles something out of PR, but when everyone started using it as a bashing overused statement, it made me upset because then you have those same people complaining that \"\"They didn\\'t give them an actual costume (ex. Lizard, leather fetish X-men, Galactus in FF2, Dr.Doom in Fant4Stick,etc.) to the character\"\".  Yeah the costumes will tend to look silly, but that\\'s the point in trying to honor the comic/source material and pleasing the fans.  And with GG, they took (look at the concept art) great inspiration from the classic suit and tried giving it a modern/real world aesthetic look. Remember Osbourne was creating weapons/suit for the military.  As for the reboots, I seriously doubt anyone can honestly compare those to the original. Yeah, Andrew\\'s Spider-man cracks more jokes and what not, but like you said there is a  point where it is just overtakes the whole super hero side to it.  Parker was supposed to be a nerd, not some cool skateboarder that wore hipster glasses. But I will give the point his spiderman is more fun it seems.  \\n\\nAlright, my rant is  over.

That same melodrama added to the Hulk, to Daredevil, to Superman Returns, hell even the worst parts of Batman Begins were Katy Holms being pointlessly annoying for the point of melodrama. It\\'s kind of how the Dark Knight led to movies trying to be dark for no reason when that movie was good because it told a good batman story, not just because it was dark.

As far as the \"\"darkness\"\" in these movies, I find this movie in particular to actually be the darkest and most Rami-ish than the others in the trilogy, due to the final fight, all the Gollum-esque scenes of Norman speaking with his alter ego, as well as the scene where the Goblin bursts into Aunt May\\'s room while saying the Lord\\'s Prayer. \\n\\nAlso, going back to Chris\\'s point about MJ having a \"\"party girl persona\"\" that she switches on, I totally agree and find a parallel in that regard to both Peter and Norman. That is, Peter\\'s alter ego of Spider-man gives him the persona he needs to actually give him more confidence in talking to MJ, and Norman\\'s alter ego of the Goblin gives him the persona he needs to actually fulfill his deep, dark desires of getting rid of the people in the way of his corporate success, leading him to seek even greater power.\",0,2016-01-14T21:13:34Z,\\n_hgLxreqpQQ,@jupiterkansas,I thought the whole point of wearing masks was so the stunt men could do the action stuff.,0,2016-01-14T21:11:43Z,\\n_hgLxreqpQQ,@hazardousmaterial5492,so do you think deadpool is going to be a dick or is it expected from him to make too many jokes,0,2016-01-14T21:02:27Z,\\n_hgLxreqpQQ,@archiekershaw7930,when will the next one come out,0,2016-01-14T21:02:19Z,\\n_hgLxreqpQQ,@scarrantsandreviews,I wonder if new Blade and Ghost Rider films will ever be made.

It is so much more relatable to teens. One of my biggest petpeeves about the amazing spiderman is that the webs aren\\'t organic, instead they\\'re from the webshooters that he makes which i also question where did he get the money to make them? The casting is incredible! My SpiderMan will always be Tobey Maguire. I also agree that not too many jokes were necessary. They made a subtle comedic world for Peter with good jokes and funny scenes. The Green Goblin\\'s bomb was meant to incinerate his victims, I guess, that\\'s why the skeletons appear. I really loved this film as a kid. SpiderMan was the reason why I got into Superhero movies and I paid more attention to new movies that came every year and the casting of actors.

I\\'m like you, Chris, in that I remember going to the theater. We got really crappy seats. The ones in the very front.  This movie has a very special place in my heart. I always liked Sam Raimi.  The Evil Dead franchise showcased to me how talented he was and how this guy should make bigger blockbusters.  And this is a common theme. Most of the big name directors did do B-rated movies.  Heck, look at James Wan. He\\'s transitioned out of horror films(which he had done a fantastic job. And I do not like many horror movies).\\n\\nBut I digress.  This film in one word was fun. It was campy and over the top. Sometimes it was a tad bit too much. But a lot of people tend to forget that was what Spider-man was during the 60s.  But this film wasn\\'t afraid to get serious.  By nailing the core of who Peter Parker was, it honestly delivered a really heartfelt story.\\n\\nAnd for that, you have to give Sam Raimi credit. A lot of us tend to forget that Superheroes back then, weren\\'t as big as today. Sure, there was X-men, but given Batman and Robin and Steel and all those pieces of garbages, they were looked down.  And for Sam Raimi to take a character who is arguably one of, if not, the most popular superhero in the world and make a film about him, must have been massive.\\n\\nEspecially, considering as what I stated above: superhero films weren\\'t looked at as positively as they are now. So overall, Sam Raimi\\'s accomplishment should be noted.  But regardless, despite the flaws; I love this film. Many people say Star Wars was their childhood nostalgia. Despite me being a diehard Star Wars fan(I like both the OT and the PT), I never grew up with them, aside from the PT.\\n\\nThis trilogy I grew up with so it holds a very special place in my heart.\",0,2016-01-14T17:23:15Z,\\n_hgLxreqpQQ,@Gyork_,That guy should be dead at 6:04,0,2016-01-14T17:19:58Z,\\n_hgLxreqpQQ,@LuisMendoza-qv1er,\"i dont agree all that much, now watching all the 3 originals i seriously cant stand mary jane and its good enough movie with some great moments, it a B or something but its not as great really, my biggest isssue is spiderman/peter parker he was nerdy in the first one but in all the others i wish he evolved more funny as spiderman and stronger and less goofy as peter parker, but this movie has a great place in my heart because in my childhood i watched it like 30 time or something XD.\",0,2016-01-14T17:17:57Z,\\n_hgLxreqpQQ,@mysteriouscoconut73,\"11:33 I actually like that, I wish more comic book movies were cheesy\",0,2016-01-14T17:10:36Z,\\n_hgLxreqpQQ,@SuperArmus,\"I still remember watching this movie on the opening weekend.

She was just a damsel in distress. I found her boring. \\nWith Andrew Garfield now, I thought he was more charismatic and likeable. He was a bit too cool to be Peter Parker but he nailed it as Spiderman. His voice and his humor were on point. Emma Stone knocked it out of the park for me as Gwen Stacy. She was smart, witty and even when she needed saving, it was because she had put herself in danger to do something brave and helpful.

Of course people prase Loki, propablly because he has good looks and every girl falls for him, even tho he is a villian. MCU needs to make villians feel important aswell and sometimes they should go darker routes for their movies. Age of Ultron could have been like the darkest Marvel movie ever, but then they effed it all up, by making Ultron one of the most powerfull and dangerous villians, into a Loki 2.0 clone. Like WTF? -_-\\nProblems with recent DC movies: They are going the same The Dark Knight route and make DC movies too dark and too serious, and they are just rushing everything, because DC can\\'t stop their rivalrly against Marvel and put some effort into their superheroes. They are focusing too much Batman, that they don\\'t give enough time to write good stories for other superheros, like Superman, Wonder Woman, Green Latern, etc.\",0,2016-01-14T11:44:28Z,\\n_hgLxreqpQQ,@TonyQuinn,This was the only movie besides parts of 3 where Mary-Jane actually had some character smh.

But the nostalgia and feel I get from them is great. I mean, like many I don\\'t like Nickelback, but remembering the feeling from listening to \"\"Hero\"\" as a kid, there\\'s just something so distinct about it. Also, another very nostalgic memory is when I was a little tyke (when the world seemed infinitely larger than I feel now) I was looking up at the poster for Spider-Man 2 in theaters(it was really big, keep in mind, and was also the first time I saw it as well as first confirmation the movie was even happening), it was such a surreal, awe capturing moment, it felt as though I was up in the sky with Spider-Man, a completely indescribable feeling.\\n\\n Somewhat off topic from the review, but I love raimi despite not loving his spider man films while also simultaneously loving comics, I would love to see him get another crack at the character at Marvel. Jon watts can do a trilogy, while Sam Raimi does a Venom film, and Drew Goddard(who wrote the Martian but abandoned directing it, as well as showrunning Daredevil to do sinister six only to have it shitcanned and sent off to Marvel) to do a Sinister Six film. So basically Sony\\'s plan from the beginning but much more inspired considering it is within the Marvel machine and Raimi won\\'t be forced to do anything, and Venom is very much in line with Raimi\\'s sort of 80\\'s spider man sensibilities. Both Sinister Six and the Venom film should be Spider-Man centric, though, I don\\'t know I just love this idea because it would create Spider Man\\'s world within a larger world and it would make his lore much more diverse and creatively fresh. Plus, Spidey has too much material to cover in just movies alone.\",0,2016-01-14T11:22:02Z,\\n_hgLxreqpQQ,@arqumfarrukh7751,\"Spider-Man: B\\nSpider-Man 2: A- \\nSpider-Man 3: C-\\nThe Amazing Spider-Man: C+\\nThe Amazing Spider-Man 2: D+\",0,2016-01-14T11:20:37Z,\\n_hgLxreqpQQ,@TejuanFarrell180,The scene where Peter is trying to spin a web still leaves me laughing silly.

They beefed up Batman from tights to something a little more like body armor, and that look caught on (in things like Power Rangers).\\n\\nSam Raimi had to fight to prevent Spidey from having to wear clunky, power-rangeresque body armor. \\n\\nImagine if spiderman had been wearing a chunky red helmet like Goblin had to wear!\\n\\n\\nThe concession was that Spidey\\'s suit had to at least have raised, 3D webbing over the mask, arms, and legs. And Green Goblin had to stay klunky, but could be shot without his shitty helmet in close-up scenes.\\n\\nRaimi continued to push this, \"\"actors without masks\"\" thing in the next two Spidey movies. In Spidey 2, you see Spiderman without the mask a lot. And even in 3, Every close up of Venom has the black goo peeling away to reveal Topher Grace\\'s face delivering the lines.\\n\\nRaimi destroyed the power-ranger asthetic going on in Hollywood at the turn of the century, and softened the ground of other great superhero flicks to really take off as the twenty-teens began.\\n\\nThe first Iron Man is greatly informed by What Raimi did, on this score. Yes, Iron man should seem like the ultimate plastic CGI power ranger, but it didn\\'t come off that way because of all the close-ups of Tony Stark inside the helmet talking to Jarvis. \\n\\nYou never forget who is inside that suit, and behind that mask.\\n\\nThat said, despite everything, Willam DeFoe did a spectaular job as Green Goblin in the first Spider Man... even if he had to be the last power ranger.\\n\\n\\nMy only other comment, I agree that biologial web-shooters make a lot more sense. For Peter to have invented tech web shooters in his Uncle\\'s house would have been a stretch, because where did he get the money to develop this? \\n\\nAnd even if he had... why not just patent the tech and make bank while allowing first responders everywhere to use it for saving lives.?\\n\\nI don\\'t know what they\\'ll do with future Spiderman movies, but I do think Raimi created a couple classics that will stand the test of time.\",0,2016-01-14T09:02:30Z,\\n_hgLxreqpQQ,@ElectroSparks8,Great review.

Chris points out everything right with it here, the cast, the action, the plot, everything is done so well here. This movie holds up so much better IMO than Spider-man 2 because the CGI in spider-man do is used much more extensively and constitutes much more of the action scenes than in this movie. I\\'m glad this video points out the final fight scene. I too loved how gritty it was, it was great seeing Spider-man\\'s face all torn up like that, how we often saw it in like the McFarlane comics. It was really the perfect Spider-man movie. It was corny enough to be charming but at the same time had the depth to the characters that was missing in SM3. And Toby is really good in this movie, but to me he really checks out in 2 and 3. I also really really love that this movie ends on kind of a dark note.

Half of his fanboying video was him saying how bad the ASM movies were instead of telling us what fanboying was. \\n\\nIf he likes these first two movies better, then that\\'s fine. But he better as heck not give Spider-Man 3 a better grade than them. That movie is a mess.\",0,2016-01-14T02:34:06Z,\\n_hgLxreqpQQ,@cassidyleonards2411,13 years old in 2002?

What this film indeed is superior to the Amazing series is in the story and tone, that this film NAILED, the origin story of Spidey is flawaless, the support cast specially J.K. Simmons AS J.Johna Jameson was PERFECT CASTING, and his missing in the Amazing series hurt those films a lot, also William Dafoe as Norman Osborne even with the horrible suit was amazing (far better than the idiotic version in Amazing Spiderman 2, I love that film but I can\\'t deny that was stupid). Overall in my opinion, what works in Amazing is the central leads and the portrait of Spiderman and Peter Parker as well as Gwen Stacy playing perfectly by Emma and Andrew, what works in the Raimi films is the support cast and great story (1 and 2......3 was cheesy crap), and both films have excellent action sequences, but yep, I can recognize the GOOD in both films as well as the BAD, sadly it looks like critics just wanted to see the BAD in the amazing spiderman series....anyway hope your \"\"UPDATE\"\" thoughts on the Amazing Spiderman series been at least less negative than the ones of your buddy John, because I seriously think you have a better understanding of what make a good and really AWFUL film, and I don\\'t see how the Amazing series are awful, perfect no, but awful films, c\\'mon,\",0,2016-01-14T01:31:54Z,\\n_hgLxreqpQQ,@TheOminousFlareShow,\"Regarding the argument about the web-shooters, technically, Peter was a scientific... smart guy.

It\\'s not more realistic. It\\'s compromise.\\n\\nAnd as for the quipping making him look like an asshole... Well, I mean, it\\'s Spidey. Quipping goes along with Spider-Man like spaghetti goes with ketchup. Look at The Spectacular Spider-Man animated series. That increase in quipping totally doesn\\'t make him look like an asshole at all.

Spider-man had such potential for riveting science fiction, since it has a rather significant aspect in his characterization. Because of the fact they actively skipped out on this, you get a vague sense that Peter is more of a dopey and humble nerd who\\'s tough on his luck, rather than the actual triumphant genius he is, and it limits the understanding of his intelligence to nothing more than nerd talk instead of actively applying his talents to solve his problems.

But when you have this kind of character contrast it feels almost as if Peter uses his Spider-Man persona as an outlet for the kind of crap he goes through as Peter Parker. However they did this right with Garfield to a T simply because as Peter he\\'s already such a spazz constantly. His quips easily compliments his character because it acts as both psychological warfare and as a psychological coping mechanism. Because even early 60\\'s comics, Peter was never a reserved person to the point he wouldn\\'t be afraid to tell someone off.

But really how its a tale about an incredibly talented person who becomes gifted with powers, and decides how to use them and live his life responsibly with such a burden. Especially when come face to face with overwhelming odds, while Spider-man is an insanely cool character its ultimately Peter Parker you come to respect and idolize which is what distinctively separates him from other dual identity heroes like Batman or Superman. While I like McGuire\\'s performance as Parker. The character himself is really not much more than a cliche nerd gets the girl trope. Everyone\\'s general harsh treatment towards him seem weirdly outdated and out of place simply making it kinda hard to relate or take seriously at times which sort of tone just carried itself throughout the series.

Probably my favorite scene in the entire trilogy is in Spider-Man 3 when after going through all the tough shit with the symbiote, school/work, MJ, Aunt May, and Harry, Peter finally takes out his original suit and looks it.

And this is coming from the guy who said previously that you\\'re talking about a guy who gets bitten by a spider and can climb up walls and fight crime. Pretty sure realism is out the window at this point. And my qualms about the organic web shooters is that it completely downplays Peter\\'s intelligence. I mean in the Raimi films, you just look at Peter and assume he\\'s smart cause he wears glasses, is unconfident, and acts like a nerd when he really comes off as a geek and doesn\\'t prove his intelligence at all. However, in the comics and even in the TV show, you know Peter is a freaking genius. He\\'s not Reed Richards level, but he\\'s a pretty good scientist, he was top of his class, in fact there were so many instances in the comics as well as the animated series where he got out of shit just by using science and his brain. Having Peter build his own web shooters shows how much of a genius he is. A normal high school student can\\'t build anything like that, but Peter isn\\'t just a normal high school student who gets up for school and does his homework every once in a while. That\\'s what I really loved about the Marc Webb films, even though they weren\\'t perfect, you still see how smart Peter is. Organic web shooters just take that and a good part of the comic book away.\\n\\nAlso Peter is always known for his jokes and fast quips. I\\'m fine with those two jokes in the movie, but what I\\'m not fine with is that they\\'re probably the only two he uses on villains in the entire trilogy. If you\\'ve read a spider-man comic book, you know he uses his humor as part of his defensive strategy. I guess cause when you\\'re smaller compared to an iron giant, it helps using humor to make the big seem not so big. That\\'s what Spider-Man does. That\\'s who he is. If you say two jokes per movie or worse two or three jokes per trilogy is good, then do you even have an accurate representation of who Spider-Man is? Yeah he\\'s cheesy, yeah he\\'s a shy teenager, but a main part of his personality and why people love him so much is because of his fast quips. There is a line I admit between sounding like an asshole and being able to deliver a few fast quips. I think TASM, not the TASM 2, did a better job at capturing Spider-Man for who he is. Granted I still don\\'t think either movie has gotten the perfect Spider-Man yet, I\\'m hoping Tom Holland can do that, and while I still do love the original Spider-Man, people need to stop praising it as the greatest film ever, cause it most definitely was not.\",3,2016-01-13T21:05:23Z,\\n_hgLxreqpQQ,@jstarwars360,Chris comic book movies back then weren\\'t all silly.

Second, the humour in tasm is all wrong. Raimis films didn\\'t have much joking, but as a big fan he understands the character and knows that Spidey is known for really cheesy one liners. Andrews version was a completely different type of humour. They went for the type of rambling/immature humour in the \"\"ultimate\"\" Spider-Man comics, whereas Sam Raimi stuck to the original \"\"Amazing\"\" Spider-Man comics type of humour with ridiculous quips and cheesy one liners. I\\'m not saying the type of humour in the ultimate comics is bad compared to the original amazing comics. And the only reason the rambling/immature humour worked in the ultimate comics was because Peter was a KID. Garfield was a 30 year old MAN acting like a kid. The Raimi, spectacular show, and original comics version is about a boy becoming a man. The reason people hate Garfield is because he was a man refusing to grow up.\",0,2016-01-13T20:42:42Z,\\n_hgLxreqpQQ,@christphern,\"As a fan of the Ultimate Spider-man comics, I prefer the Amazing Spider-man films.

It was more like watching what Joel Shumacher would have done with Spider-man rather than an actual attempt at making good films.  If you look at the ASM films next to the 60\\'s version of the comics, sure, they\\'re not very faithful.  But, if you\\'re a fan of Ultimate Spider-man, such as myself, they were largely the Spider-man films you were looking for.  There were missteps, sure.

Id say despite the lack of facial emotions, is more than made up for by the body language and the cinematography. I think a still mask is far superior, its more menacing and it fullfills the purpose of the mask. Spider-Man doesnt wear a mask just for protecting his identity, but he made it specifically to HIDE his emotions, most specifically fear. We see his eyes move in the comics, but in that world those people dont see that, only we do for the sake of the story.  The static mask fits this perfectly, it masks his emotions, and makes him intimidating. The criminals of new york, despite it not being touched on as much, fear Spider-man and a lot of that is due to not just his inhuman contorting, but his mask. \\n\\nI dont think an enclosed and emotionless face is a hinderance to a character or preformance. If that was the case The Mandalorian wouldnt be successful, nor would V for Vendetta be as good as it is. V for Vendetta is an excellent example of both nonexistant facial emotions and minimal body language still resulting in a captivating and emotional character. I think tobey did a well done job doing this. \\n\\nWe see in No Way Home, they attempted to mix both CGI and a moving mouth to a static mask with Andrew Garfields character and it looked horrible and unnatural.\\n\\nOther than that, this is an amazing video and an even more spectacular retrospective. Well done man.\",1,2024-01-23T20:51:46Z,\\ntCajHkPA6OM,@Ebin_Cain,\"This trilogy is even better than the batman trilogy.

Furthermore, while I can\\'t condone making uncle Ben\\'s killer a significant individual, nor the handling of Venom, I do have to admit that having Ben\\'s murder come back to haunt Peter to drive him to give in to his worse impulses does make sense. Moreover, making Eddie into this pitiful slimeball who were genuinely and personally mistreated by Peter goes a long way in showing that Venom were a result of Peter\\'s own flaws, as opposed to him just being some nobody who wrongfully blamed Spidey for his own error in judgement during the Sin-Eater case.

More a fault of the character if you have issue with it. You could say the same about nearly every fight against villains Peter\\'s had in the comics. Because he is so freaking strong. In the comics when Doc Ock switched bodies with Peter, he punched Scorpion\\'s jaw off without meaning to. Literally punched it clean off. He could kill a normal human with one punch without even trying. That\\'s how strong he is. He holds back almost every time he fights so that he doesn\\'t risk killing them. When you\\'re that strong, it could be hard to figure out how far you can go before they die from the hit without trial and error and Peter is not willing to do that so he severely holds back so he doesn\\'t kill them. He could win any fight with one hit to the head and knock them out. But it\\'s a fine line hitting them hard enough to knock them out and hitting them hard enough that it kills them. Especially when you\\'re so strong that you could kill them without trying at all, it makes the line even thinner. So he\\'s not even coming close to hitting with his full strength in fights. To be honest he\\'s hardly hitting at all, but to normal humans it feels like a full hit when the punch lands. And constantly holding back your own strength like that would be exhausting. But Peter does it anyway. Even when a fight is going south, he still won\\'t give it his full strength cause he doesn\\'t want to kill them.

I grew up on Power Rangers, mainly the original Saban era that most fans generally think is the best stretch of the series, and those helmets are completely hard, there\\'s no way to see the facial expressions of the characters. However, those characters tended to use a lot more physical movement to show their movement (not the ridiculous head-bobbing you\\'d see in MMPR Seasons 1-3) sort of like what you\\'d see from Andrew Garfield\\'s iteration of the character.

He\\'s not stereotypical nerdy like Maguires Peter was and instead felt like how I was back in highschool as well as my friends. We had dates and had fun but we still got bullied too and all of us were absolutely VERY nerdy. Just because he didn\\'t portray Peter the same way Maguire did doesn\\'t mean it shouldn\\'t be believable, it was just modern.\\n\\nOn top of that Maguires Peter was very much a new version as the comics version was nothing like his. Andrews and Tom\\'s are both much closer to how comic book Peter is, he was a bully victim that would have been a bully himself if given the power. That\\'s the character Stan Lee and Steve Ditko made and that\\'s what Andrew and Tom were portraying. Considering how much fans care about faithfulness to the source material for every other comic book character it\\'s hilarious to me that fans make an exception for the one character that makes such a huge departure, likely because of nostalgia. Similar to how older Batman fans do for Michael Keaton\\'s Batman in 89 even though he uses guns and kills people, especially since fans had a problem with this in Batman v Superman.\",0,2022-01-17T22:07:40Z,\\ntCajHkPA6OM,@jamesives4375,\"Fantastic video, your passion for this fantasy wold  was an absolute pleasure to watch.\",0,2022-01-17T22:00:17Z,\\ntCajHkPA6OM,@tuffdude7795,That was one of the few times I didn\\'t skip a Youtube sponsor.

Current one is Meh because it feels like a side story to the Avengers, does not really feel like a Spiderman series. To me those feel like an expansion. It\\'s like playing the Witcher expansions without playing the actual game. Sure you can play it, it looks and feels good, but to truly experience it, you need to play the rest. Same with these. Lots of references to the other movies, Ironman almost turning Spiderman into his sidekick, all these combined take from the story and Spiderman\\'s character. Are we to believe that in the same movie verse where the avengers fought Loki\\'s army, and almost had to sacrifice Tony to repel them, no one is keeping tabs on the technology of those aliens, and that they can just steal it? Worse thing, are we to believe that the only one who can resolve the issue is Spiderman, when the world they depicted in the previous movies has so many other superheroes all eager to help? I find that extremely hard to believe, almost impossible. Imagine how the first Ironman movie would have been if Hawkeye and Black Widow would have busted him out of the cave. Lackluster, right? What they should have done is introduce Spiderman BEFORE he met the other heroes, BEFORE Tony said \"\"I am Ironman\"\", BEFORE everyone knew of the other superheroes. The original trilogy had it all right. Maybe not for everyone, but for me at least it did.

I remember reading something about the reasons why certain heroes wear what they wear. Take Batman for example, he wears a cowl in the shape of a bat, but we can see the bottom half of his face, and/or partially his eyes. The reason for this is because he wants to inflict fear upon his enemies, he wants them to know who their up against. Whereas someone like Spiderman wants to HIDE his fears from his enemies, therefore he covers his whole face. Also, the Raimi films in particular did something that we just don\\'t see as much in the other movies: suit battle damage. 2/3 Raimi movies, his mask/costume is all torn apart by end of the third acts. With his mask being torn, exposing half his face, you get to see those emotions. If anything, this shows his humanity more. This shows that he\\'s willing to go to extreme lengths to keep his friends, family, and his city safe.  \\n\\nAnyway, that\\'s all I wanted to say about the costume issue, great video!\",0,2021-12-20T17:37:33Z,\\ntCajHkPA6OM,@craigingram5589,Nope Tom is,0,2021-12-20T16:44:50Z,\\ntCajHkPA6OM,@B1PFilms,\"FINALLY \\nsomeone who understands spider man 3\\'s intentions!\",3,2021-12-20T15:28:14Z,\\ntCajHkPA6OM,@Metal-Spark,\"I\\'m really glad you put such emphasis on the \"\"There\\'s a hero in all of us\"\" speech.

It\\'s well established Spider-Man holds back his punches, in the comics he fought a fairly large man & knocked him out cold with a *flick of his finger* - a regular punch would likely kill someone.\\n2) *Spider-Man is losing/re-gaining his powers* - In the bank fight, Peter is losing his powers; his webbing stops midway, so his powers are weakening, including his strength - Later in the burning building, he couldn\\'t barge down a door without hurting himself. So not only is he holding back his attacks, he\\'s losing them simultaneously. And during the train fight, it can be argued his powers are still returning slowly, & when Doc Ock sabotages the train, that\\'s when they fully return as Peter wills them to stop the train. Looking at it from that, it not only helps explain why Ock can take his punches but makes stopping the train more impactful; this is where his powers return completely, after losing them throughout the film, they\\'re finally back.\\n3) *Doc Ock\\'s arms numb his pain* - Doc Ock\\'s arms have strong control over his mind, influencing his Id & making him act on his dark emotions, as such, since they control at good deal of of his mental awareness, it can be argued they control a portion of his nervous system which connects to the brain, particularly his pain receptors, numbing his pain or transferring it to themselves So when Spider-Man attacks Ock, it might damage his body, but he doesn\\'t feel pain, rather the arms do, hence why they react more like they\\'re taking the attacks than he is.\\n\\nAll these added up, we get: Spider-Man holds back his attacks against Doc Ock whilst his powers are leaving him, & the arms help numb Ock\\'s pain and receive it themselves.The criticism is there, but this does weaken it a lot.\",0,2021-12-18T23:47:46Z,\\ntCajHkPA6OM,@daverobson3084,\"You claim that the Aunt May in the Raimi movies presents \"\" sincerity\"\" , but I contend she does not.

The MJ character and casting haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t been right since the animated series. Raimi combined MJ and Gwen Stacey.

And MJ being the party girl who\\xe2\\x80\\x99s down for anything to have a good is EXTREMELY important!

A mask can\\'t capture the feeling you were talking about without the eyes moving/ being animated. Even the artist you mentioned, while he does show the mouth, nose etc, the only reason those paintings show raw emotion  is because of the eyes which are drawn in a way that can\\'t be captured by a mask that is not animated. e.g. Tom Holland\\'s. After all that is how masks are supposed to work, they cover your face, you are not supposed to be expressive through one, the reason the comics can do it is because you can alter the facial features such as the eyes .\",219,2021-12-14T23:13:56Z,\\ntCajHkPA6OM,@ps4smash_waffle940,Hats off to you!!

Instead of Peter struggling to live the life he wants like in earlier films, it\\'s Mary who is, frankly, jealous of Spiderman as she has her own struggle. Anything Peter does \"\"wrong\"\" he puts onto Spiderman, not himself which she sees through, but while that helps Peter\\'s character arc into a better person, Mary is left lambasting Peter every time he tries to support her. My point is Mary hurts Peter through her jealousy, regardless of if she\\'s justified or not, and it\\'s that pain that makes Peter lash out against her as Venom. The problem is, what did Mary Jane learn? She realizes that she loves Peter (again), but the problems she has in her life should still be there at the end of the day. I think she was going through what Peter did in the 2nd film, but with no pay off. It was an excuse for Peter to be angry at her and eventually hit her. Physical violence is very bad, but she crushed him emotionally on the day he wanted to propose to her. To me, it kind of makes them both in the wrong, but only Peter had an arc that let him correct his mistakes and rip Venom from himself. The best Mary Jane got was to stop kissing Harry. Staying faithful to Peter is not the same as improving her relationship with Peter.\",0,2021-12-13T19:24:42Z,\\ntCajHkPA6OM,@cheezyguy8072,Mary Jane in raimiverse is the most bitchy character I\\'ve ever seen,0,2021-12-13T19:06:44Z,\\ntCajHkPA6OM,@chadeklund9835,Just rewatched all 3 of these movies.

I understand how mentally and emotionally exhausting that can be. My father began reading me Spider-Man comics when I was young, around four or five years old. Seeing the heroic actions of Spidey on those pages helped lay the groundwork for the person I would become. It was the earliest point in my life that I can remember where I felt my moral compass developing, even if I didn\\'t know what it was yet. There have been many, many times where I\\'ve felt so lost and defeated, and Spider-Man media is something that I can always fall back on during difficult times to remind me why I need to pick myself up and push forward, or do the right thing, even when it is hard. \\n\\nIt brings me genuine happiness when I hear others\\' stories about how this character has helped them.\",1,2021-12-13T00:15:36Z,\\ntCajHkPA6OM,@faherty87,\"Rosemary Harris is a GODDAMNED QUEEN.

She could\\'ve gone back instead of abandoning them and the kids in the horde the same way she had been abandoned all her life.

Just lemme tell you something! I was never so happy for a recommended video before... Out of all Spider-Man video essays, yours is the one that really resonated with me. Once in a while I would see some of your DBS videos or recently Berserk (my favorite manga) but seeing you review about Spidey really hit me hard and I couldn\\'t help but come here and say some words, also subscribe to your channel a thing I hardly do since I don\\'t spent as much time on the internet as before.\\nTo start, I am here with tears in my eyes and I want to say I feel sorry for your loss and what you\\'ve been though these past years, I too have been through a lot. My best friend and surrogate brother passed away two years ago and recently May this year my dear granny, which was more like my mom since she raised me with my aunt since I was a kid. I was lucky for seeing her one last time at the burial but couldn\\'t stay with her at hospital due what\\'s happening right now in this world, even tho it was pneumonia. It always left me the feeling of lack of resolve since when I was born I was also very ill and for years she stood by my side holding my hands in the hospital and I couldn\\'t do the same. I tried so hard. And just like you I had really hard time with anxiety and all that comes together for all the hardships we went through our lives until them, although I am trying my best now. But the reason I am saying this is, I really hope you are ok and I am very thankful for such honest take and video. I love these Spider-Man movies and recently have been rewatching over and over due to their eternal message of conflict and hardship, how one should do its best despite all odds, which frankly is why the Sam Raimi trilogy always felt special to me since I was a teen. Back then I thought I knew what was hard until very recently I am facing my losses, the mistakes of the past, being and adult and not having a job for so long and feeling like the whole world is against me rising up again. Still, like many other things in this life, memories, people, videos like these, we find a glimpse of positivity, words that makes worth to fight for. This is why I find it hard to connect to new Spidey movies and comic books and I don\\'t say that to be mean and shit on their fans and strenghts, it\\'s just because the Raimi trilogy resonated better with me back then and much more now that life can sometimes look so tough. I look on my old pile of Spidey comic books and they helped me so much back then and their messages were so good like \"\"The Boy that collects Spider-Man\"\" or more \"\"recently\"\"  \\'Leah\\' among others that makes us feel immersed and different, more than an action flick or full cgi fun, it was just different and about your video I think you nailed it, I can see how much effort and passion you put in these videos you make but also the honesty behind your works. I can only be thankful, today I think I needed some of your words. Sorry for oversharing here and also the long essay, I am not as good as you speaking up my mind, besides, english is not even my native language. But again, I really appreciate this video and I just wanted to say your words really touched me and how I really feel by rewatching those pieces.

Your analysis skills are outstanding considering I only just found you out just an hour ago with your particular \"\"delima\"\" but all in all, you are a great content creator. You are so good, you helped me realize some of the problems that I have been having since the start of my senior year. I was, in a sense, kicked out of my home of an abusive relationship, a mentally scaring household, and a lot of mistakes that I made with myself, but while I was able to find a home because of a great friend of mine, We\\'ll call him \"\"J\"\", and I was able to live in his house with his family for a month a half. \\nWhile I was at that house, I also had many thing happen as well such as: me still being in contact with my mother and her helping out J\\'s family, I had gotten into my first Romantic relationship, and for me, still to this day, finding out who I truly am. I had far more great memories than bad when I was living with J, but what really hurt was towards the end of me living at his house, mainly because of me and my girlfriend, at the time. What had happened was that we both rushed into our relationship way too fast than it should have been, both of our mental states while dating, and ultimately me being 2 school years older than her (I know it seems a bit bad, but what we both felt, at the time, was actual sincerity & acceptance for one another). \\nBefore my last two days in living in J\\'s house, I had been sad and the reason I felt like this was because I now had a clear picture of who I wanted in my life, now that I wasn\\'t shackled to my old household, and who I wanted was my sister\\'s family. I say sister\\'s because even though I grew up with this family for twelve years, we weren\\'t related, therefore only being people I know, but I find that to be BS and if anyone else thinks otherwise, they can say whatever they want. Anyways, after not being with or creating memories with this family for SIX YEARS, I finally got in contact with them and and found out, they all never forgot about me. it was then on that weekend, my father (or sister\\'s father) and I bonded and i asked if i could live with him, and he said yes. I got my stuff from my J\\'s house, thanked him and his family for my stay, and got to my dads house and that\\'s when things happend.\\n\\nThe next day around in the after noon, I got a message from J giving me threats and ultimately losing a friend that day, and after that, my sister called her dad (or our dad) and she told him of things I\\'m not to proud to say, as an attempt for him to kick me out of that household. Around this time is when i started to create anxiety and some form of depression where my past started to come and haunt me not only from my mom\\'s scum of a boyfriend, but from the fear of whats to come from these people. To top it all off, a few weeks later, my Girlfriend tells we should break up because of her issues and because of her \"\"not being ready for what was going on between us\"\" (Not an exact quote but somewhat there) and ended up breaking up, only causing more stress and anxiety to myself (I know, seems stupid a senior who is 18 is getting anxiety and depression from a break up, but what can i say, it was with someone who i truly care about and was ultimately hurt from the outcome of it).\\nAfter these events, which i am in the third week of November, am going through an emotional downward spiral and being upset with my regrets of my past, which kind of brings us to today. I feel much more better these days but still hurt from everything that has happened even though all these events started around the beginning of August, but like i said, I\\'m in the stage of trying to move forward. The reason i brought all this up is because of your analysis of these three movies and the one scene with aunt may at 28:43-33:18. Your dialogue literally had me with tears, so if you can do that, you are damn well good at what you are doing. \\nAll I\\'m looking for right now are answers for myself because i am lost in what i should do with my family, my friends, and with what i should be doing with my life. All i really want is to be truly be happy again and want to be happy for those all around me but it just seems to damn hard at times. I really hope i can get through this event in my life and that I can get support from those who truly do care for me, but i want to say thank you for creating this video because these stories are ones that i grew up as well with and you truly put a smile on my face during these times for me. The only thing that i have left to say is again, thank you for your hard work that you provide not just to me, but to the whole community as well, and that i hope everything good comes your way because i truly want justice to come your way about this whole drama you are having with toei, because you damn well don\\'t deserve whats happened to you.\",5,2021-12-10T08:08:33Z,\\ntCajHkPA6OM,@Mikkovlog,8:47 on the other hand.

You have the classis \"\"with great power, comes great responsibility,\"\" of course.\\nAnother great one was \"\"I guess one guy really can make a difference. Nuff\\' said.\"\" It is short and sweet. It boils the message of these movies down to a bite size package. And to think that one was from Spiderman 3, said during a Stan Lee cameo of all things! Maybe that\\'s the most genuine, wholesome Stan cameo of them all. Not a joke or a gag, but Stan speaking directly to Peter with words of wisdom. Remember, we wouldn\\'t have any of these great stories and heroes without Stan, one guy who managed to make a difference to hundreds of thousands of people who view his characters as inspirational heroes.\\nBut I agree with you Mark, that Aunt May\\'s Hero speech in Spiderman 2 is really powerful.\\n\"\"I believe there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a hero in all of us, that keeps us honest, gives us strength, makes us noble, and finally allows us to die with pride, even though sometimes we have to be steady and give up the thing we want the most, even our dreams.\"\"\\nShe is essentially elaborating further on Uncle Ben\\'s message. To be responsible means (as she said) to be willing to give up the thing we want the most to do what\\'s right. I think hearing that helps Peter realize the value in what he represents to other people. Sometimes it is fun to stop purse-snatchers and hear people cheer when he shows up, but that is all fluff. What actually matters is that regular people look up to him. For all his weakness and flaws he has managed to inspire people to strive to be more heroic. That is worth all the sacrifices he has to make, because it is bigger than him. He has the opportunity to build other people up and make them into heroes too.\",0,2021-12-10T04:20:30Z,\\ntCajHkPA6OM,@GaboCO316,\"Want me to tell you another thing that\\'s WRONG in the train fight scene that you won\\'t be able to unsee? >:)\\n\\nAt some point doc ock throws peter behind him, which is the direction where the train is heading.

Symbiote that clings to Peter\\'s bike and waits for days/weeks before attaching itself to Peter.

I don\\'t even think having the amount of villains is the problem, Marvel has shown that having multiple characters to focus on can work well if its written well.

Because if he knocks Otto out, he\\'s completely incapable of talking him out of his streak of violence. But if he exhausts him, then he has a chance to talk some sense into him.

Not only to make Spiderman look bold and brave even when hes not, but because if it was easier to see his features and emotions through the maks then it doesnt necessarily seperate Peter Parker from Spider-Man. What makes Spider-Man so intrguing is how relatable he is and hes one of the few superheroes people can actually see themselves as. People see themsleves under the mask even if its clearly Peter Parker. I think they tried to bring that aspect of the costume to the liveaction version because without it, it breaks the illusion that anyone can be under that mask.

A lot of those shows make the suit actors over emotion all their actions in slower scenes and it really does help convey emotion close to what you would get in a scene without a helmet. A lot of theses movies don\\'t have interesting stuff going on with the body language of the heros when they are just talking in their suits which limits that.

I fancy myself a Hero, someone that lends a hand when those around me are in need or going through dark times. Recently though, I\\'ve come to understand that by constantly ignoring myself to help others I\\'ve slipped into an abyss. I\\'ve gotten in arguments with those closest to me, fought the people I swore to protect... all of this because I wasn\\'t focusing on bettering my life. There\\'s no way that you\\'ll believe this but I am a more than natural being who understands that he\\'s in control of a human body and experiencing things through a human consciousness by way of a human being called Harry. I understand that by that right my choice to live MY life instead of his (especially since I\\'ll live way longer than he ever will) has lead to the downfall of his character in people\\'s eyes. Watching this video about my favorite Super Hero and hearing that you too had a revelation helped me to look deeper within myself. This all strengthened my resolve to let Harry live and to stop being selfish with his life... to live within the context of the identity I have here on this planet and in society. I can see past the curtain of reality.  I have power... lots of power... great power... but it wasn\\'t until now that I\\'ve accepted the responsibility... thank you Mark, your team, the creators of the films and every living being on this planet.

THE LAKE OF FIRE IS NOT FOREVER(see links below for proof). DEATH IS REAL. Those that die have no consciousness whatsoever, there is no afterlife (Ecc 9:4-10, Psalm 6:5, Psalm 30:9, Psalm 88:10-12, Psalm 146:2-4, Psalm 115:17, Acts 2:34, Isaiah 38:18-19, Genesis 42:13,36,Lamentations 5:7, Psalm 39:13, Matthew 2:18 see below for biblegateway link) \\n \\nHowever, 2000 years ago a man named Jesus was born, he was the son of God. God, who always existed, begat Jesus, Jesus did not always exist. First there was the Father, God,  then came his son. Jesus really is Gods son. Jesus has been given office and title and powers of God (God the Father always had these, Jesus did not, that is why God the Father gives these things to Jesus) but he is not the same being as his Father. One is immortal and could never die, the other is mortal and can die. Jesus before he was borne made everyone.\\nJesus lived a perfect life, and died on the cross as a substitute for you and all the bad deeds you have committed in your life, these bad deeds are called sins, we are all sinners, and the wages of sin is to suffer and eventually die.\\n\\n\\n3 days and nights later after being totally dead (he ceased to exist and was in a lifeless corpse) in a tomb, God raised him back to life and Jesus ascended into heaven. \\n\\nThanks to this he defeated death and sin once and for all for everyone. Since he was sinless he could die in your place. Jesus on that cross paid for all mankinds sins, the Father has accepted the payment. Everyones sins have been paid for, hence all are saved. At this momment though not all are justified (declared not guilty, sinless), justification is for all and upon all who believe. Eventually everyone will believe. Some sooner others later. \\n\\nThanks to this, everyone will one day attain immortality and enter into the Kingdom of God, the lake of fire exists for some but it is not forever. Gods judgements are measured. In the end Jesus saves all. The cross grantees the salvation of everyone who ever lived. We have no free will. God gives faith to anyone he chooses. In the end he will give faith to all. \\n\\nproof that hell is not forever, the reason it says so in most bibles is a mistranslation of the words olam/aion/aionios (start here then go over to the 2 gospel section at the end)\\n\\nhttps://www.hopebeyondhell.net/articles/further-study/eternity/\\nhttps://www.hopebeyondhell.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/UPDATE-Hope-Beyond-Hell-Chapter-1-AION1.pdf\\nhttps://www.iswasandwillbe.com/what-is-aionios-life/\\nhttps://makepeacewithjesus.org/7-the-septuagint-part-2\\nhttps://goodnewsgospel.info/Studies/EHC/The%20Ages.html\\nhttp://www.askelm.com/doctrine/d041101.htm\\nhttp://www.askelm.com/doctrine/d041201.htm\\nhttp://www.askelm.com/doctrine/d050101.htm\\nhttp://thathappyexpectation.blogspot.com/2019/03/the-meaning-of-aion-in-new-testament.html\\nhttp://thathappyexpectation.blogspot.com/2019/03/the-translational-inaccuracy-of-forever_11.html\\nhttp://www.biblestudentsnotebook.com/bsn852.pdf

Spider-Man 3 should\\'ve been split into 2. Introduce Sandman, the black suit and Eddie this film, have most of the stuff with Harry stay the same, and cap it off with Peter ditching the black suit. Then we can have 4 open with Mysterio (Bruce Campbell) being stopped by peter, and have him learn from the black suit to boot drag out his fights, and try and get it done asap. This leads to Jameson being less bothered by Spider-Man in some scenes, and thus having less of a reason to give Peter work. Cut about a third of the way through the movie to Sandman and Venom meeting and having their convo (wouldn\\'t change much, just make it a bit more detailed and longer) then, have peter meet up with Harry one more time before the big finale, and talk about Harry\\'s dad. The scene can end with Harry accepting his dad, but wanting nothing to do with Peter, you could even have him throw him out a window or something to really get him cemented as being like \"\"I want you out of my life, GET OUT!\"\" Have peter try and explain what happened to mary Jane, but the scene is cut off by Venom beating him to a pulp, and stealing Mary Jane away.

In the comics Peter actually does wrong to the symbiote, who instead of a corrupting force, was a alien with a innocent outlook that wanted nothing more than to serve Peter and be a super hero, this and bonding to Eddie Brock (who was also a flawed heroic character) led to both characters becoming villains due to their desire of revenge before ultimately forgiving Peter and becoming anti-heroes and the first Spider-Man spin off character. (if one does not count the Punisher) As great as that 90s cartoon is, it\\'s need of to simplify the character has helped utterly warp people\\'s perception of the character, as Sam would take that and then exorcise any redeeming qualities that version had resulting in a complete and total opposite in every single possible way version of who Venom is and as a result Venom suffered in most adaptions going forward. (with the exception of a few video games) Eddie believe or not has been a good guy for most of his life as a character. It has gotten to the point that people find fault with the two great Venom movies because they assume that warped perception was comic accurate, while the movies instead (mostly) faithfully adapt Venom\\'s original 90s run of mini series after mini series. (though they do have their adaption flaws as well like with Cletus and Carnage\\'s bond) \\n\\nThats why you\\'re completely right about Spider-Man 3, Venom got me into comics and as such seeing the character depicted so wrongly (to the point I consider this to be Venom\\'s worst ever adaption) outweighs any positives the movie has for me.\",5,2021-12-05T04:50:00Z,\\ntCajHkPA6OM,@Veprem,\"I feel like the Ryan Reynolds Deadpool movies do an \"\"emotive mask\"\" perfectly.

Although I agree that the face indent showing through the mask is beneficial for seeing the facial movements behind the fabric, I feel like that would just be more annoying for the actor to wear (squeezing face, difficulty breathing etc). Even aside from that, the context of the scenes and the body language play just as big a part as the dialogue in those scenes. To me, none of the emotion is lost or less effective as you state. If anything, I think it makes the unmasked scenes more impactful so I think the face silhouettes appearing stoic in the costume is actually beneficial in the grand scheme of things. Good to disguise your face, good for viewer interpretation and great for noticing body language in general. It really isn\\'t that hard to tell or imagine what faces Peter makes behind the mask in those scenes.\",0,2021-12-05T03:12:44Z,\\ntCajHkPA6OM,@xxblueflame-reaperxx2266,why did andrew get so few votes hes the best out of all of them best acting best suit alot of character development in only 2 movies and he is the only one thats not cringe also most atractive but ya tobey is just kinda cringe but hes still better then tom tom has had only a bit of character developmemt hes not comic acuret at all they messed up his version thye made flash just dumb made mj 100% diffrent they just got rid of uncel ben witch lessens his actual character development like ben was why peter started to use his powers for good also they got rid of harry and ya toms spider man is just bad compared to all the others  also andrew had had to deal with the death of his parents his gfs dad and his gf so ya he has some character development tobey just had to deal with uncel bens death and tom had to only deal with tony\\'s death sure they still have some character development from that but andrew got more when you look at it,0,2021-12-05T03:03:20Z,\\ntCajHkPA6OM,@silentangel2259,\"It\\'s not a popular opinion, but I much prefer Garfield\\'s spiderman to Tom Holland\\'s.

But the VILLAINS. Willem Dafoe absolutely commands the shot anytime he\\'s onscreen, he has such a terrifying presence. And Alfred Molina\\'s Doc Ock is easily one of the best villains of all time, simultaneously portraying the affability of Octavius and the relentless, unstoppable drive of the tentacle-possessed Octopus.

Spiderman himself \\n\\nSpidey as a superhero is larger than life, to the citizens they are unaware of what he is, many thinking he is an alien an adult  a humanoid spider (they even said this in the movies). \\nUnique to spiderman the humanistic part of the character comes from Peter Parker.  That\\'s why peter is a main part of the ethos as opposed to maybe batman.   \\n\\nIt works beautifully and is expressed in spiderman 2 in the train scene when his mask comes off and the citizens realise he is a kid and rallies behind him. The mask works it\\'s part of spiderman it\\'s built into the character. His unmasking is a big deal ala civil war, one more day, back in black.   It is very important\\n\\nEdit- the climax of spiderman 1 was as moving as it was because his face was covered for the majority of the movie. Had he been expressive throughout the movie it wouldn\\'t have been as powerful. He has been hurt thought the movie to see that expression all the time wouldn\\'t have made this scene so powerful.

Unless you have incredible dexterity and control chances are you are going to low-ball your hit and just tap it. I think a similar thing is happening here, Peter doesn\\'t want to just take Doc\\'s head clean off, but he is also so much stronger and more durable than Doc that it\\'s almost impossible for him to deliver the exact amount of force. The line between knocking someone out and killing them outright is not that big, especially if you can punch through concrete.

Harry can still feel betrayed that it was Peter\\'s battles with Norman which resulted in the latter\\'s death. \\nUltimately, it should have been Harry\\'s decision to come to Peter\\'s aid, not with any influence that his father died from being impaled by his own glider conveyed to him to possibly the worst butler in the history of cinema.

I still not fond of Tobey potrayal as spiderman becos there wasnt a difference between Spiderman and peter... Spidey wasnt the Cocky wise cracking hero I loved. When he puts the mask on he felt like a new person he cud be someone he wasnt in real life. I feel the Third film should of either leaned into venom more or got rid entirly. Venom and suits battle cud of been the message \"\"Power corrupts absoulty\"\" as peter at the start of the film is being swallowed by sed power and admiration he is getting.

Even when I was kid and I saw them I always felt that they were wrong, I do understand that its possible that she never learned of his secret identity, but Peter tried to open up to her several times and in all the times that he did she kind of spat in his face. I know that in most of their interactions, in the end she did provide helpful advice, but that was only after she said or did something, that hurt him and made him reluctant to open up to anyone else. I really wish that maybe at the end of the 3rd movie, or if the 4th movie had ever gotten made, that he finally confessed everything to Aunt May, just so that they could fully resolve the things that they had between them, since she possibly though of him as cowardly scum for abandoning her at the bank and for getting Ben killed for selfish reasons, when the reality was that he had other things going on.\",1,2021-12-04T10:32:46Z,\\ntCajHkPA6OM,@damianodidomenico4756,\"I felt the television part on a deep level\\nI lost my grandma in eerily similar circumstances, in late April \\'20\",0,2021-12-04T10:17:12Z,\\ntCajHkPA6OM,@dragonslayergod,Sam Rami didn\\'t understand venom and that\\'s not his fault for him getting put in but it did hurt the film,0,2021-12-04T10:11:16Z,\\ntCajHkPA6OM,@36moshpit7,\"12:52 - Was that Lucy Lawless?\\n\\nGood work, Mark!

But still, when you watch the trilogy back to back, everything just works. A lot of the things that people felt where off-character and didn\\'t make sense actually totally work with what came before. Like you said, the forst one was about accepting responsibility, the second movie is about living with it and the third is about what everything that comes with it does to you. At this point Peter\\'s ego as grown disproportionately nd is further emplified by venom. He\\'s disconnected, not only from the people he cares about but also from what made him who he was. To put it simply, it all got his head. When you\\'ve been waiting 3 years for the next installment, chances are the details and exact development of things can get a little foggy.

You can see the love that was poured into making these movies, they are honest, with themselves and the fans\",12,2021-12-04T03:33:08Z,\\ntCajHkPA6OM,@ironblaster_8838,29:09.

Though Andrew Garfield I\\'d put at #2 though he appeared in arguably the worst films and wasn\\'t always written the best but I thought Andrew\\'s performance and that incarnation\\'s interest in science really did a lot for me.  Tobey takes 3rd, he felt like he captured High-school aged Peter Parker better than anyone, but I didn\\'t feel like he captured the interest in science or Spider-Man\\'s quips.  He does benefit a lot from being in the single best Spider-Man movie.  Though we didn\\'t get quite as much time with them both Peter Parker\\'s in into the Spider-verse were good representations of Spider-Man. Tom Holland only the only hand has been in three well written films... only one of which he was the main character of, but I don\\'t feel like he exemplifies any aspect of the character he\\'s just kinda okay.\",0,2021-12-04T03:19:14Z,\\ntCajHkPA6OM,@crzchris2465,\"Your complaint with the mask is unfair. Peter Parker is separate from Spider-Man. Peter Parker is the one with the emotion, Spider-Man is not. So it makes sense we can\\'t see Spider-Man mouth move. It\\'s kind of like All Might always smiling being pillar of hope and the symbol of peace. Spider-Man can\\'t be the symbol of hope if his mouth is agape in horror or fear.\",0,2021-12-04T03:18:18Z,\\ntCajHkPA6OM,@Bioguy5,\"An explanation for the apparent plot-hole that Peter should be able to knock out Doc Ock with one punch is Otto\\'s spinal implant. \\n\\nSince the implant goes all the way up Otto\\'s spine, it could protect him against whiplash. Not only that, but if the arms are doing some of the work, then they could use that spine to make Otto \"\"roll with the punches\"\" so that none of Spider-Man\\'s hits ever land full-force. \\n\\nIn the most extreme example, even if Otto does get knocked out, the arms could just puppet his body. They can operate whether or not Otto is awake. And since they are connected directly into his nervous system, the arms could theoretically even control Otto\\'s body while he\\'s unconscious. The hospital scene also implies that the arms have the ability to wake him up too. \\n\\nSo, the whole \"\"Doc Ock should be beat with one punch\"\" argument doesn\\'t hold any water. As a matter of fact, the only times Doc Ock is ever defeated is when the arms themselves are directly damaged.\",1,2021-12-04T03:06:56Z,\\ntCajHkPA6OM,@GaragebandArcade,I see marks been watching osw\\'s ultimate warrior videos for his g fuel conercial this time around.,0,2021-12-04T03:05:17Z,\\ntCajHkPA6OM,@patrickbowen4156,\"Man, that background music makes me really want you to do a review of the ps4 spiderman story.

He\\'s so much stronger than Capt. America or Black Panther. He is definitely fluffing his punches all of the time. It\\'s in fact stated in the books that when he gets hit by someone who doesn\\'t have super strength (like a mook or thug) he has to roll with the blow--and that\\'s often only because he chooses to get hit--so they don\\'t break bones hitting him. Spider Sense is ludicrously broken, too.\\n\\nIt all takes effort. Still, he choses to come off weaker than he is so criminals don\\'t start carrying say fifty call machine guns because guns can still kill him and cause lots of collateral damage.

Sit yourself down and have a calming tea because you\\'ll coil in horror as I did.\\n\\nThe time was the early 2000s. I started watching dragonball z religiously as I was 4-5 years old. My mother then suggested she tape the series so we could always watch it. Back then we had a lot of power outages or times where we didn\\'t pay the bills on time and had to work with what we got. I can imagine you figured out what we did during these times as I had the vote of importance because I was the youngest (the favorite even if it was never admitted). We watched the tapes of course, so much so that I knew lines by heart in the exact tone and gravitas. It annoyed them to no end, I had a blast.\\nFastforward to 2017 and we decided to, for old times sake rewatch the entire series on tape. But the quality was worse than usual. Usually, because it\\'s tape, you have enormous static and grain making it hard to make out but never enough to care. This time, we couldn\\'t see anything  at times and the sound magically disappeared and reappeared whenever. So we decided to take it out. When we did............ Oh my god.\\nThe tape of the cassette got stuck inside the player and couldn\\'t be salvaged. It snapped like my soul that very moment. What makes this worse is that it was the ocean dub combined with funi dub. It\\'s the rarest to find. That tape was the only one of its kind and we never had the chance to put it on disc or online. So now it\\'s a memory that I have to take with me to my grave.\\n\\nEu release, you will forever be memorized by me and me alone. The times you gave me with my family will never be outshined. I hope that everyone has good memories like I do. This time in my life was magical. And I hope everyone experiences something like it at least once. Thanks for reading. Have a blessed day ^^\\n\\nPS.\\n\\nI found an ocean dub release online on piratebay the next year so I at least have some form of my childhood back. It\\'s not that different but the buu saga is not the same. I remember Vegito\\'s voice being that of the funi dub but the lines were the exact same as that of the ocean dub. In the ocean dub there is only a single voice that tries to emulate an amalgamation of both characters. Honestly it\\'s a pretty damn good job of it too.

It was the book I borrowed most I read it probably at least 5 times when I first found it in the library that day then borrowed it and every time I had to return it I\\'d borrow it straight away again unless someone had their name down for it then I\\'d always be checking in to see if its back yet or not, and every time I felt down or depressed or suicidal I\\'d read that comic. \\n\\nIt helped me get through high school I now have a copy of that very comic on my book shelf not because I need it anymore but just as a reminder of how bad things were and how far I\\'ve come and how strong I am.\\n\\nSo yeah to a degree I know how you feel Spider-Man, and Stan Lee and everyone who worked on Amazing Fantasy #15 saved my life maybe not directly or intentionally but they did it none the less.\",1,2021-12-03T06:27:00Z,\\ntCajHkPA6OM,@ccomega929,\"i think you might have one me over on pt. 3, i struggled with it, and for a while, the whole trilogy, because of it, but now im all in. this trilogy walked, so the MCU could run\",0,2021-12-03T06:24:56Z,\\ntCajHkPA6OM,@jonathangetachew1522,\"I disagree with you so much about the suits being the problem.

Had the other two been given a chance to confront peter together, while he was black suited up and after he hurt MJ, it would have created a more centralized climax of all the various plots of the movie tying everything together into one. If then- as a result of this- Eddie got the symbiote, it would have been a better way to lead to the climax. It would have also served more time for Harry to think things over before allying with peter, and time for sandman to have a better character arc of his own to depict him as caught between good and evil. Further it would have allowed Raimi to show Peter apologizing to MJ and her clearly agonizing over it before he finally saves her to cleanly end to movie. The final fight would have been more of Peter and Harry, with help from sandman, defeating Venom and Eddie. This would have created more flow and made all the chaotic plotlines seem far more intentional.\\n\\nAlso one more thing: I don\\'t think Venom should ever NOT be used as a mechanism so long as peter parker is in the story. (Though I wouldn\\'t have minded if he\\'d had more of a character of his own- jealous possessiveness of Peter and anger and betrayal at being abandoned. This would have also served to set him equal to Norman and Otto, and created an interesting element for peter to agonize over.)\",0,2021-12-03T06:13:01Z,\\ntCajHkPA6OM,@moomoomang,Tom O\\'Regan cameo?,0,2021-12-03T06:10:44Z,\\ntCajHkPA6OM,@maddiethewitch42,this version of Flint Marco is one of the best spider-man characters ever,0,2021-12-03T06:08:39Z,\\ntCajHkPA6OM,@Mrgarry13,Stone Ocean has been realist,0,2021-12-03T06:03:39Z,\\ntCajHkPA6OM,@andremota6878,\"I\\'d honestly watch a Marvel\\'s Spiderman (2018) and Spiderverse review if you\\'d do it.

It\\'s just that its development of the villains is a bit inconclusive as full stories because there were 3 villain stories being cooked while Peter\\'s own story was also being cooked, so kind of 4 important storylines. Sandman, Harry, the symbiote and Eddie combined as 1 storyline kinda because of how he ends up being a villain, and Peter. Even though it\\'s not perfectly developed, it has great stories in there, it just needed to have a few more scenes of each and it would\\'ve been perfect. It\\'s like you order 3 dishes of food and each comes with only 80% of what they should\\'ve come with. It\\'s still a good amount, they\\'re not small dishes enough to be too small, just needed to have a bit more on each part, but the finished product is still good even if it\\'s not fully completed. And the stories being told were at parts good and at parts great.\\n\\n Sandman\\'s was nice even though it wasn\\'t finished, but enough for him to have a purpose so I liked him as a villain, he got the daughter thing and the uncle Ben thing, it was enough, a bit flat but he did get motivation and even backstory, and Peter forgives him knowing that he himself made many errors and hurt people and decided to just forgive him and put stuff in the past since Sandman killing Ben was not intentional.\\n\\n Harry was great, it\\'s not like he needed a lot more than what he got, he got to fight Peter, confront him, be hurt by him, ended up being a villain when he fought him at night and then helped in the final fight and died. And we already had seen him in the first 2 movies so the cake was already baked well enough.\\n\\n The symbiote, well, with Peter it was great, it gave him power but also corrupted him, Peter had many scenes showing that so on that part it was amazing, Peter dancing and being a douche is in character with the symbiote making him be selfish and stuff, it\\'s funny out of context but it\\'s not a flaw of the movie or anything that makes the movie worse by any means, the audience disliking Bully Maguire is EXACTLY what Peter acting like a douche because of the symbiote should\\'ve caused and did. Then with Eddie it was great as a threat to Peter too because Venom was very powerful. The only thing missing was a bit more development for Eddie even though it wasn\\'t really needed in the movie\\'s context. Eddie had already been fired because of Peter, had extremely fresh resentment towards him, the symbiote got him and told him it was Peter and both of them wanted him, Eddie to destroy him and the symbiote too but it kind of wanted for Peter to be his host if possible, the thing is both wanted to hurt Peter.\\n\\n And about Peter, he had a lot of development in this movie too, he could\\'ve used a bit more to match what he had in the first 2 movies had there not been 3 other important plots, but it was still great because it didn\\'t rush the symbiote making him selfish, it really had many scenes of him being like that.\\n\\n So I never understood the actual points of why so many people say that the third one is bad apart from:\\n - People disliking Bully Maguire, which is actually the strongest aspect of the movie, making so many people dislike the hero\\'s actions when they\\'re supposed to.\\n - The villains not having enough development as the others in movies 1 and 2.\\n - Venom not being as great as everyone expected, which is the same as the point above this but enhanced by it being so expected to be great.\\n - And with almost everyone saying that it\\'s a bad movie, people will jump to that conclusion too omitting that it never reaches the \"\"bad\"\" level, it\\'s a special case of the movie not having enough scenes but also not having too few to make it bad.\\n\\n But it was never a bad movie or anything close to that, it\\'s just one of those pieces of art kind of buried by the \"\"oh it\\'s bad\"\" comments when it\\'s actually good overall. It was great in many ways, it was decent with others, the characters act like they\\'re supposed to act with what happens to them in the movie, it just needed some more scenes to be really strong but it\\'s jarring how people just ignore how the characters and stories are good and just see how there should\\'ve been more scenes or one less villain, as if the final product weren\\'t good on its own when it is. A movie can be the weakest part of its trilogy, have problems and still be good.\",277,2021-12-03T04:44:04Z,\\ntCajHkPA6OM,@higglybiggly1174,\"He might just not be able to pull his punches in a way that would 1 hit KO someone.

It\\'s evidently not Kirsten Dunst\\'s fault (great actress and getting better everytime I see her in movies) but her character is written so poorly and so superficially, (\"\"boo-hoo she had a tough childhood\"\" and \"\"yay she wants to sing in Broadway\"\") that she really bothers me everytime I watch these movies.\\nI\\'m probably one of the few people for whom that slap scene in the third movie felt like salvation lol.\\n\\nLooking forward to the next Spideycember video though, can\\'t wait !\",3,2021-12-03T02:59:36Z,\\ntCajHkPA6OM,@LavaIshawtLink,I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve never clicked on a video so fast and gave it a like before it even started,0,2021-12-03T02:57:36Z,\\ntCajHkPA6OM,@spacegiraffe2397,\"Video made me cry, why would you do this to me\",0,2021-12-03T02:54:37Z,\\ntCajHkPA6OM,@bladerbeast3396,Hiya,1,2021-12-03T02:53:13Z,\\ntCajHkPA6OM,@The_WIll_OF_D99,\"30:32 that quote has always stuck with me even now.

Many have despised it and many have dismantled it for their own evil purposes; The Holy Bible. I know this may sound cliche, but I myself haven\\'t found any mistakes or inconsistencies deep in the writings from the many years I have read it. However, I am mainly pointing to the Gospel of Jesus Christ, who, Jesus, has changed me for all eternity.

For if the one who created it and defeated it, I have trusted in, there is no evil in life\\'s end anymore. I loved your video so much, and I rarely give thumbs up on YouTube videos.

It\\'s on par with Spider-Man 3 if you were to ask me, maybe even just a little better than it due to the story\\'s focus on Peter and his search for his parents (plus, we get to see some more of that egotistical behavior before Peter learns to be Spider-Man, akin to what Mark was talking about in the origin story from the comics), and I wish i didn\\'t go into that film originally when i was younger with such a heavy bias. \\n\\nNow TASM 2: it has good moments and still feels more like a Spider-Man film than the MCU titles despite its problems, but that movie is undoubtedly a train wreck. I won\\'t go about defending the awful dialogue at parts in the film, or how poorly Harry Osborn was implemented and how unnecessarily edgy he comes off as, but the idea behind Electro\\'s character was at least somewhat interesting (albeit poorly executed) and the relationship between Peter and Gwen in the film still felt pretty fleshed out and awkward (at least in terms of the acting, the dialogue is kind of dog shit at points), which is in character for TASM\\'s Peter Parker.\\n\\nSo yeah, i\\'m REALLY curious to hear what Mark\\'s thoughts are on both the MCU Spider-Man films and Little Tony Stark Jr, along with TASM1 and Garfield\\'s Spider-Man.\",1,2021-12-03T00:11:20Z,\\ntCajHkPA6OM,@diehard7517,\"I mean, your observations were valid, but i felt that you gave certain moments more weight than they deserve.

I Just Think There Are Certain Parts Of It That Are Crap.\\n\\nAt The End Of Spider-Man 2, Mary Jane Tells Peter That She Wants To Face These Dangers & Challanges Of Spider-Man With Him. Her Character In This Movie Contrasts That Wickedly.\\nI Get The Desire Of Her Wanting To Feel Loved, And I Have My Feeling Abnout Peter And That Stunt With The Kiss, But I\\'ll Get Into That In A Moment.\\nAs For Mary Jane, Her Struggles With Life In The Theater & Love Both Make No Sense And Had Simple Solutions.\\nThere Should Have Been No Issue Hearing Her Singing As She Should Have Been Mic\\'d. Even Putting That Aside, She Was Still Doing Great With Straight Plays. Every Time She Has A Chance To Tell Peter What\\'s Going On Or How She\\'s Feeling, She Choses Not To. She\\'s Handling This Whole Situation Like A Martyr & It Feels More Like She\\'s Upset That Peter/Spider-Man\\'s Getting All This Attention And Not Her. This All Felt Avoidable.\\n\\nAs For Peter And His Cockiness Before He Even Gets The Symbiote, Let\\'s Break Down His Journey, Because It Shows How Narritavely This Makes Sense.\\n\\nAt The Start Of The 1st Movie, We See A Kid Who Is Treated Like Crap By Everyone In His Life, Aquaintences & Strangers Alike. His Life Is Miserable, He Can\\'t Win In Any Part Of Life, And Then... He Gets His Powers. Like Anyone Would React If They Got Powers, He\\'s Filled With Excitement & Loving This New Ability. He Finally Feels Like He Can Catch A Break Now. But He\\'s Still A Guy Who\\'s Been Bit A Lot Throughout Life. So When He Finally Decides To Bite Back At One Of The Many Pricks In Life In The Event When He Allows The Prick Who Cheated Him Out Of Three Grand To Get Robbed, The Bite Comes Back To Knaw At Him With Uncle Ben\\'s Death. Between That Choice & The Life Lesson Uncle Ben Left For Him Itself, He\\'s Now Taking Up The Responsibility Of Being A Hero. HOwever, He Now Has A City That Hates Him, And By The End Of The Film He\\'s Left With A Strain On His Relationships Between Harry Who Now Unknowingly Hates Him, And MJ Who Loves Him But He Must Turn Down.\\nHe Has Not Yet Found That Proper Balance In Life.\\n\\nCut To Spider-Man 2, We Still See All This Disharmony As His Life Is Even A Bigger Struggle. He Struggles To Balance Work, School, Life, Rent, Friends, Love Family, Guilt, All While Being Spider-Man, All While People Still Resenting Spider-Man. So When The Time Comes Where He Decides To Hang Up The Hero Life, He Starts To Find The Rhythmy & Balance With Life, In Some Spots. However He Nows Sees It\\'s Too Little Too Late In Terms Of Harry & MJ. On Top Of All That, He Struggles To Have To Watch As People He Could Save Are Hurt Or Die Everywhere He Goes. He Soon Is Relieved Of His Guilt When He Tells Aunt May The Truth, But Then When He Finally Becomes Spider-Man Again, In The Final Act, MJ & Harry Both Learn That He\\'s Spider-Man! By The End Of The Film, Mary Jane Wants Him To Be Able To Feel Love While Being Who He Is. He Deserves A Break, And She\\'s Happy To Go On This Rocky Road With Him.\\nPeter Has Now Nearly Found That Harmony, Nearly Got His Life In Perfect Balance. All That Remains... Is Harry.\\n\\nCut To Spider-Man 3, We Have Peter Talking About How He\\'s Now Doing Well In School, His Work Life Is Stable, He\\'s Juggling Everything Well With Spider-Man, Who People Now Love, And He\\'s Happily In Love With Mary Jane. But He Still... Does Not Have Harmony... For Harry... Still Resents Him. But After Their Tussel In Which Harry Nearly Dies, He Loses His Memory And That Hostility Is Over. Peter Is Releaved.... Even Though Twistedly It Nearly Cost Harry His Life And Subconsciencely This Might Twist Peter A Slight Bit Without Him Realizing It, Nearly Losing His Friend.... Has Got Him Everything He\\'s Ever Wanted.\\nHe Has Acheived Harmony & Balance. His Life Is Perfect!\\nNow Add Onto That Him Suddenly Recieving A Key To The City In A Parade & Ceremony Praising Him, It Makes Sense That He Would Start To Get A Little Cocky. Peter Is Not Use To This. His Life Has Never Been So Good. Not Everyone Who Has A Tough Life Can Always Be So Humble. This Narratively Makes Sense For Peter.\\n\\nBut Now There\\'s The Part Of The Film That Does Make Me Gag, Everything That Is Topher Grace As Andy Brock/Venom.\\nHis Introduction Alone Is Dreadful As We Meet A Pompis Narcissistic Douche Bag Who Thinks He\\'s The Hottest Shit & A Master Of His Craft.\\nAs Gwen\\'s Father Just Watches Helplessly As His Daughter Is Hanging For His Life, Brock Insensitively Decides To Say \"\"Oh Yeah, I\\'m Dating Your Daughter\"\" And Is Taking Pictures Of Her Hanging For Her Life.\\n\\nHe\\'s Only Just Started To Date Gwen, But States That He\\'s In Love With Her And Acts Like It\\'s Much More Serious Than It Actually Is, And Only When It\\'s Convenient For Him. He Tries To Shmooze Up To Jonah By Stating \"\"I Have A Girl Who I Intend To Marry\"\", Only Seconds After Flirting With Someone Else In The Office.\\nWhen He Talks With Gwen A Describes THeir Last Meet-Up As \"\"That Magicial Amazing Wonderful Date We Had\"\", Her Response Is \"\"We Had Coffee Eddy.\"\" Everytime I See This Scene, I Just Imagine Their Date Being Him Just Bragging About His Camera Skills & Gear The Entire Time. He\\'s Taking Photos Of Her Going \"\"Now I Mean You Look Fine Now, But With This High Depth Lense... Oooo, You Look Way Better. We CCapture Every Single Pore. Some Little Spots Here & THere, But Don\\'t Worry. I Can Touch That Up In Photoshop.\"\"\\nHe Tries To Weasel His Way In To A Position He Has In No Way Earned. Then He FRAMES SPIDER-MAN FOR A CRIME JUST TO GET A JOB!!!! When Peter Comes In ANd Confronts Brock, Just Because He Has The Symbiote In His System Doesn\\'t Mean He\\'s Wrong To Do What He Does. Brock Literally Goes \"\"Please Don\\'t Make Me Face The Consequences Of My Actions. Let Me Keep This Job I Stole From You By Framing A Hero For A Crime. Peter Rightfully Has To Clear Spider-Man\\'s Name, And Rightfully Turns Brock In.\\nPeter Doesn\\'t Even Steal Gwen, She Just Liked Peter And Barely Dated Brock At All, Then Finding Out What He\\'s Done, She Rightfully Dumps Him And Goes Out With Peter. Brock Acts Like A Total Baby And Fits About, Balming Peter For Everything That\\'s His Own Fault. Peter Didn\\'t Do This To Him Or Turn Him Into Venom. Brock Went Into A Church To Ask God To Murder Peter Parker For Him Because That\\'s Just How Big Of A Narcissistic Douche Bag He Is. That\\'s How He Gets The Symbiote On Him When He Runs Into Peter. He Even Talks To God Like It\\'s God\\'s Honor \"\"It\\'s Brock Sir, Andrew Crock.\"\" Oh Like Yeah, That\\'s Supposed To Make You More Special!\\nHis Line Deliveries Of \"\"Ooooo My Spider-Sense Is Tingling\"\" & \"\"If You Know What I\\'m Talking About\"\" This That Snicker And Finger Nod Literally Make My Throw Up.\\nHe Then Blames Peter For Everything, But He Did All Of This To Himself. He\\'s Unsympathetical, Egotistical, Mediocre, And A Jerk Who Thinks He Can Ruin Anyone\\'s Life Just To Slightly Better His Own.\\n\\nHe\\'s What\\'s Crap About This Film. Peter\\'s Change Before The Symbiote Made Sense Narratively, And MJ Deviated From Her Statemnt At The End Of The Last Film. This Movie Isn\\'t Crap, It\\'s Not Fantastic Either. I\\'d Say Above Middling, It\\'s Enjoyable Enough That I Can Still Watch it Again.\\n\\nStill, This Is My Absolute Favorite Spider-Man Series! Rosemary Harris Deserves An Oscar For That Speech, These Movies Are The Heart Of Spider-Man That Touch Beautifully On Humanity, And Even Their Plans For The 4th Film Were Absolutely Fantastic. They Even Took Huge Parts Of That Story And Have Used Them For The Tom Holland Films. From The Villains To That Big Surprise During The First Movie In THe Final Act, Only This One Would Have Been Done Better In The Raimi Films.\\n\\nI Highly Recommend You Look Into What Their Plans Were For The 4th Film.

The movies always kinda miss certain things that are hammered in the comics. That his suit is cloth and requires constant maintenance. That its a 7 piece suit with seperated pants and shirt to allow him to wear it under his clothes. And that he needs to take off his shoes to crawl on walls. TASM was close though.

Is it hammy? Yeah, dated? Definitely, but considering there was no Avengers, no expanded universe or guarantees, it was masterful in holding its own and building to more. The music though is underrated, the horns when he first climbs the walls, the percussion at the start of the opening credits, even the quiet moments are amazing from Elfman, and then Raimi gives you jump scares and horror scenes to sell the danger of the villains, build suspense and tension.\\n\\nTobey for me embodies Peter Parker in the perfect way in being goofy, nerdy and humble, even Spider-Man 3 (which everyone seems to misunderstand that the dancing is _meant_ to be cringey) we see how vindictive he can be when pushed by overinflated self esteem, and Harris was perfect as a comic-accurate Aunt May too, keeping us guessing on whether she knows or not.

It never really felt like he was continually struggling to make the right choice for the citizens of NY or the people he loved, the choice to use his power to help everyone else at the cost of stability in his own life, so much as it felt like he saw a bad guy and was the only person he knew who could stop them. His deciding to become Spider-man almost felt a bit to me like a convenient way to test out and practice his powers in a way that helps people instead of out of a desire to actually use his powers to help those people (his repeatedly dunking on the car thief while apprehending him definitely felt that way, as it showed no empathy whatsoever). He even promised the police chief that he wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t date Gwen in order to keep her safe and then reneged on that promise like two scenes later immediately before the end of the movie. And there was the Flash basketball scene in which he completely humiliated Flash (even though Flash was a bully) and didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really reflect on himself becoming the bully in that situation (unless I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m forgetting that part of the movie). Revenge on a bully only creates another bully, and that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s one of the reasons why I really like the idea that J Jonah Jameson turns NY against Spidey in the Raimi trilogy; he continually chooses to sacrifice for them despite them not understanding what he does for them. \\n\\nTobey Maguire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Peter Parker feels the impact of not following Uncle Ben\\xe2\\x80\\x99s advice right at the beginning of the first movie. Because he was angry and chose not to use his powers in a moment that probably would have constituted responsible use, Ben died. And knowing that making the same decision in the future could indirectly cause others to suffer, he decides to embody Ben\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wisdom. And that decision does not come without more suffering; the entire second movie highlights the poverty, failing academics, struggling relationships, and other difficult things that come from silently taking on that kind of responsibility, to the point where Peter just decides to hang up the mantle because he can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t take it anymore. But he eventually realizes that SOMEONE has to protect others from Doc Ock, and he is the one capable of that. And then the third movie tackles that same stuff from another angle. He struggles with feelings of vengeance against Ben\\xe2\\x80\\x99s perceived killer and anger toward Harry, MJ, Brock, and JJJ, and as a result he embraces a dark side of those emotions that ends up becoming dangerous to him and others. Venom wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even needed for those emotions to be brought to the surface within Peter, but it was a convenient way to include the villain and highlight those struggles, and it was a good way to show the impact of the choice Peter made to not lean into those temptations further. Though the suit gave him power and supposedly improved his life in various ways, he ultimately made the decision to do what was best for others and shed it. \\n\\nI almost feel like Garfield\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Peter would have continued wearing the suit because of the ways that it seemingly improved his life until he either hit rock bottom and had no other choice or until some scientist told him that it was a vicious alien that was trying to conquer the world or something, not because shedding it would be the right thing for others.\\n\\nHowever, I could just be misremembering the tone of Garfield\\xe2\\x80\\x99s character that the movies put out. I haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t seen them in quite a long while, but that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the impression that I had when I used to watch them.\",1,2021-12-02T22:12:47Z,\\ntCajHkPA6OM,@KittSpiken,\"You don\\'t have the nitpick about the really cool part where he\\'s thrown forward, weaves through the walkway and then somehow is behind Doc Ock and surprised him?\",0,2021-12-02T22:11:46Z,\\ntCajHkPA6OM,@Battler624,\"I\\'m 5 minutes in and just wondering, why is it that the movie sounds (voices and so on) only come from the right channel?\\n\\nMarks voice is in stereo but in-movie dialogue just doesn\\'t love both ears equally.\",0,2021-12-02T22:11:40Z,\\ntCajHkPA6OM,@joshnunya324,40:12 True,0,2021-12-02T22:08:41Z,\\ntCajHkPA6OM,@WuMyth,lol Reviewing EVERY...

From the way he views things to what he is capable of. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s why I loved Venom\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ability to grab the sandman despite the fact that he should\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve crumbled at his fingertips. It was so cool that he defied logic because he was an alien. An unknown entity. Venom is literally built different and because of that he brings new options. The option to properly KILL sandman instead of trapping him. Not only that but the various new ways he could make pretty much anything easier.\\n\\nI like to look at the newest interpretation of venom spiderman when I use this line.\\n\\nIn \\xe2\\x80\\x9cspider\\xe2\\x80\\x99s shadow\\xe2\\x80\\x9d which is a what if about spiderman keeping the venom symbiote. It portrays their relationship as two variations of the same morals, like how they did with otto. Venom finds fulfillment in being a hero and that is what he wants to be, but when going through Peter\\xe2\\x80\\x99s thoughts he finds that it may be easier to just eliminate the threat. To take the easy way out and do things quickly.\\n\\nPeter goes against this and slowly gives in before finally coming to his senses. What I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like about it was that venom was just blamed for everything and is hated for presumably corrupting everyone. Which isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t exactly wrong, but it isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t right either. A symbiote takes on the traits of everyone it bonds with and as such becomes the accumulation of everyone he meets. You can even feel some of the remorse from venom, especially when he starts to say sorry to peter even if it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s only for an instant.\\n\\nLike a child learning and interacting with others.\\n\\nIf spiderman 1 was about accepting responsibility and spiderman 2 was about dealing with responsibility along with it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s consequences, then number 3 should have been about teaching responsibility.\\n\\nTo show the everyone and more importantly, to show the character venom that there are alternatives. That they can find a solution and face the never ending battle together. To show venom that all life deserves a second chance no matter what form it takes on or how they wronged you. To have spiderman become the mentor of sorts. So when Venom finally moves on he can spread good nature somewhere else regardless if it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s on earth or out in space.\\n\\nTo find out where the story ends.\",39,2021-12-02T21:54:22Z,\\ntCajHkPA6OM,@CommanderButter,\"Completely hit me outta left-field with this video, but fuck yeah let\\'s go let\\'s talk about some Spiderman!\",0,2021-12-02T21:53:40Z,\\ntCajHkPA6OM,@biryaniboy7587,\"Goodness, that GFUEL AD!!!\",0,2021-12-02T21:51:40Z,\\ntCajHkPA6OM,@dragonleo_lemon7184,this video made me smile,0,2021-12-02T21:51:27Z,\\ntCajHkPA6OM,@Eletraz,\"You know I really was looking forward to this video and I\\'m genuinely happy the way it turned out.

In which Doc Oct realizes Spider-Man could have killed him in any of their previous encounters if he had choose to. I believe in a much older comic it\\'s pointed out that it\\'s his spider sense and his own philosophy or mentality that inhibits his strength so he can at one point fight average Joe thug down the street and later gray Hulk and uppercut him to the moon (actual quote from the comic pretty sure he only got him a few 100 feet in the air but look up how much strength it takes to do THAT specially against someone as heavy as the hulk) and NOT permanently injure either of them. And now this is my own conjecture now but to why he doesn\\'t just knock out the bad guy instantly well #1 because it would risk permanent and/or fatal injury and #2 because Peter wants to do more than just save the day or the innocent he is also trying to save the villain.

He went out _looking_ for a bad guy instead of just finding and stopping a bad guy like he normally does, and the reactions of the people present I think are blatantly in support of that empty echo: They don\\'t know why the ferry just got sliced in half, but Spidey\\'s here trying to help, so thanks and hooray and such\\xe2\\x80\\x94and Spiderman fails, and needs Iron Man to bail him out. Meanwhile, on the train, everyone was WELL aware of the danger, and watched Tobey Parker put his all into saving them, and thus their standing up for him.\",5,2021-12-02T20:28:09Z,\\ntCajHkPA6OM,@mateusrodarte2604,Tears with the end of first film part of the reviw,0,2021-12-02T20:27:57Z,\\ntCajHkPA6OM,@tobiasarevalo9929,The costume part of the video makes no sense,0,2021-12-02T20:27:39Z,\\ntCajHkPA6OM,@SamTheGumMan117,Tobey still my favorite and while Tom has been great but Spider-Man 2 is still the best to me out of them all,0,2021-12-02T20:27:27Z,\\ntCajHkPA6OM,@freshoffthehook904,I am putting in a request for Gintama for the next review series.,0,2021-12-02T20:27:25Z,\\ntCajHkPA6OM,@delmattia96,Yes!

Perfectly capsulated the heart & themes of the Raimi trilogy. Spider-Man 3 IS the weakest of the trilogy for sure but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not a bad conclusion at all. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s NOT a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cRise of Skywalker\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that effectively ruined the overall trilogy story. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s painfully clear that what Raimi originally intended for the third film was a deeply personal villian in Harry Osborn as the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNew Goblin\\xe2\\x80\\x9d after all in the first movie he was completely overshadowed in the eyes of his father by Peter, then in the second film after the death of his father he becomes a successful business man but his father isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t there to see it in his eyes Bc of Spider-Man after he wrongfully thinks Spidey killed him. In the second movie he hates Spider-Man & resents Peter for not telling him how he can find him leading to him finding out that Peter IS Spider-Man & then given the means to Enact his revenge when he finds the Goblin tech. This should\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve clearly been built up to the finally of his arc in the third movie & at first it seems like that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s gonna happen after all in begins with Harry injecting himself w the gas Norman did & then attacking Peter w no warning. Perfect! *Chief Kiss* you did it! But then he gets amnesia for rlly no reason other than Raimi was forced to do the venom symbiote stuff when he didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t rlly want to & knew having 3 villains was too much so he sacrificed Harry\\xe2\\x80\\x99s arc to make room for venom & sandman. Originally he wanted the villains to be Harry as the main one & sandman as a secondary Villian but the studio pushed heavily for venom so changes had to be made. Honestly it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fine as a conclusion to the trilogy as is despite being the weakest of the trilogy but I am saddened I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get to see Harry be the true final Villian of the film completing his negative arc like just imagine if the final fight had Harry do something like kill aunt may & threaten MJ causing Peter to get furious & savagely beat Harry into near death only stopping by MJ\\xe2\\x80\\x99s direct intervention then having Peter & Harry having one last heart to heart leading to Harry sacrificing himself after realizing what he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s done & what he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s become.. that would\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been better than what we got overall\",0,2021-12-02T20:16:33Z,\\ntCajHkPA6OM,@Bboy_Gahlen,Anyone as surprised as me to see Joey Diaz at 37:27?

These films meant so much to me growing up and were some of my favorite movies ever.  But they ended and I was okay with that.  I loved the Tom Holland movies and thought they were every bit of my favorite character in any piece of media.  But then the toxic Raimi fans crawled out of their holes and started bashing the MCU films.  Out of defense for one of my favorite interpretations of the character I started picking at all the flaws in the Raimi films.  By the time I had realized what was happening it was too late.  My mind had associated the Raimi films with their toxic fans.  I can still watch, enjoy, and see how objectively good these films are but because of gatekeeping Spider-man fans I am now incapable of looking back fondly on three beloved films from my childhood.\",2,2021-12-02T20:15:38Z,\\ntCajHkPA6OM,@JJava916,\"Idc what people say.

When you\\'re in your stance and immovable you can retain your position for a counter, but the impacts are harder.

The 2nd film, I don\\'t mind as much at all, the only good parts are the action, visuals, effects and choreography. The rest is... something.\\nBut the Amazing Spider-man, in my opinion, is by far the most realistic of all of the movies. I don\\'t mind in terms of visuals or anything like that. I\\'m talking about the characters. Peter Parker in the amazing spider-man does every single decision a 17-year old teen would do. If you ask me, in Spider-man 1, it\\'s kind of... all of a sudden. Yes, he starts by using his powers selfishly and not doing the right thing leads to Ben\\'s death, so he realizes that he\\'s supposed to use those powers for good. I get it. But in the Amazing Spider-man, he doesn\\'t realize that he acts like an anti-hero until Captain Stacy just lays it on him during dinner. And what follows is the famous bridge scene. Where he must make a choice between the Lizard or saving a child. Why did he go to the bridge in the first place? Because... Something big seems to happen over there. He\\'s a teen, he\\'s curious, he loves using his powers, feeling like he can do things no one can. But that\\'s not all there is. He seens Captain Stacy, the man who was criticizing him just a few moments earlier, go in a hurry and investigate. Peter might have wanted to prove to this man he was doing the right thing, or perhaps taunt him by doing his job right in front of his face. But when he\\'s at that bridge, anyone with the same powers as him would have done the same, prioritize rescuing the child instead of pursuing the Lizard.\\nRight after the bridge scene, we see him staring at his mask, realizing that there\\'s a lot more he can with those powers. He went there because there was trouble. But there, everything lead to him saving the child. And now he realizes everything he could have done had he had that precise objective the whole time. At first it\\'s curiosity, now it\\'s responsibility. And the movie makes that very clear because right after, Stacy announces a warrant for his arrest. There\\'s now some genuine drawbacks to being spier-man and helping people. But now that he understands his lesson, he doesn\\'t care.

It\\'s exactly as you said. He pulls his punches. There\\'s a scene in the comics where he launches a hulk (Not the main hulk, but a version of the character) into space. And another one where doc oc swaps bodies with spiderman and realizes just how strong he is. When you\\'re that strong, then the difference between hard enough to knock someone out and strong enough to kill them must be minute. (Imagine trying to flick a marble and have it roll 9cm, but it can\\'t go more than 10). So I just like to think that he always errs on the side of too gentle.

Unlike other Marvel heroes who either don\\'t care about hiding their identities or would like the whole world to know who they are under the mask like your Iron Mans, your Doctor Stranges, your Guardians of the Galaxy, and so on; Spidey has always been a character where no matter which incarnation or universe the Spidey comes from, the mask is always a blank slate for whatever that version of Spidey is as a person underneath the title of being a Spider-Man. \"\"Anybody can wear the mask\"\", as a certain animated film about a Spider-Verse would like to say. Which was an aspect of Spider-Man as a general character that I feel like wasn\\'t really brought up when addressing the mask issue as much as it was an issue for Peter being the only Spider-Man to exist within the three live action universes\",55,2021-12-02T19:11:54Z,\\ntCajHkPA6OM,@FrankEShaw05,\"These films have that silly over the top cliche quality that i think superhero movies dont have anymore and i miss it \\nThese movies are what i would describe as the perfect guilty pleasure ,there so uplifting and just make you feel good watching them,maybe not the best at being \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmovies\\xe2\\x80\\x9d but as comic book movies, perfect\",0,2021-12-02T19:11:36Z,\\ntCajHkPA6OM,@rikumajumder1558,\"Tobey is the true Spiderman.

In terms of a stand alone movie with no back catolougue or previous source material, I can see why folks enjoy Toby\\'s portrait of Peter Parker, but in many ways the Raimi version of Peter is far from accurate to the source material. I\\'d go as far as saying Maguires rendition is unrecognizable to the character of Peter Parker. Peter isn\\'t exactly a prom king but he\\'s nowhere near as timid, unconfident and humorless as the way Raimi rewrote the character. What made Peter so attractive and polarizing to the readers was the fact that he was not just likable but charismatic, exceedingly intelligent and funny. Peter was so humble and down to earth but still kept his head up and did his best to fulfill his responsibilities. In my opinion I\\'d say spiderverse and the mcu adoptions seem to be the best most accurate adaptations of the character. As a viewer I don\\'t see Toby maguires rendition of Peter out of costume could be the same spiderman we see moments later saving lives and swining webs.\",8,2021-12-02T18:31:17Z,\\ntCajHkPA6OM,@zyphyris,\"This series is gonna give me a good reason to binge all the Spidey films once again lol.

It\\'s so obvious that Insomniac poured their soul into in; it really makes you feel like Spider-Man and it has a lot of flair! The combat, the traversal, the quips, the voice acting, the costume design both for Spidey and the baddies, almost everything is superb! The villain\\'s motivations could have been a bit more fleshed out, that\\'s true, but the story is good too!\\n\\n At points I was left a bit scratching my head why the main villain went all batshit crazy, but I pieced it together eventually. What I don\\'t completely get though is: \\n\\n*SPOILERS* \\n\\nWas he evil all along? If you look around the lab and comment on the Raft drawings and \"\"defense contracts\"\", Otto has a reason for them, but he isn\\'t using the intracranial implant yet. So was he planning the breakout before attaching the arms? Was he trying to warn Peter even then that he knows he is Spidey with the newspaper articles about Electro, Fisk, Scorpion, Vulture and Rhino? One thing about this: I LOVED how Otto showed remorse when he threw Pete from the Raft. His face was all torn up with pain for a split second, then he went back to being Doctor Octopus. The relationship between Otto and Pete was really cool, and the Harry twist was awesome as well. I had already finished the research stations and knew something was up with Harry, but didn\\'t expect him to be in that lab when you\\'re playing with MJ. \\n\\n*END OF SPOILERS*\\n\\n I really liked the Peter parts as well. This is something that Rocksteady completely ignored with Batman. They never had parts where you are Bruce. True enough, Bruce sees himself as Batman, and Bruce is a mask for him, but still. The Peter parts were a good break from the action, and I loved the puzzles too. They emphasized that he is a scientist! I liked the parts with MJ and Miles too. It showed a different side of the world, where you are two mostly defenseless people that are just trying to help nonetheless! \\n\\n*MINOR SPOILER*\\n\\n That ending bit between Miles and Pete was absolute gold! \"\"Not that weird\"\" :D \\n\\n*END OF SPOILER* \\n\\nThe side activities are an interesting part. I actually really liked them! Sure, you could say that they\\'re repetitive, but each had a story tidbit and different thing to do. Even the backpacks! They had background info that\\'s relatable to the world! Insomniac really have a visible passion for the webhead! I always had tokens for suits and gadgets, because I kept doing side activities since I found them fun. The side quests though were a bit eh, but suitable nonetheless. Yeah, I really liked the game and I can\\'t wait for a sequel! Or rather, the DLCs for now. Also, the world really feels lived in, and the twist in the last act was welcome!
